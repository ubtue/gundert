<p>The "Gundert Portal" is the result of a DFG funded project that started in 2016 at the Tübingen University Library. Main aim of the project is to catalogue, scan, and make available as open source all the textual material that is part of the Gundert legacy.</p>
<p>Gundert legacy contains not only printed books and pamphlets in Malayalam, there are also palm leaf manuscripts, notebooks of Gundert as well as booklets in Tuḷu and Kannaḍa.</p>

<h1 class="ut-heading ut-heading--h1">Hermann Gundert</h1>
<p>Hermann Gundert studied Theology in Tübingen, where he also learned Sanskrit (1835 Dr. phil.), later on, once in England, he studied various Indian languages, as Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, and Urdu. In 1838 he started working for the Basel Mission in Nettur in a Malayalam-speaking area. He established a Malayalam school and focused on the analysis of the Malayalam language: in fact by him is the first Malayalam Grammar (a copy of the first version from 1851 belongs to this collection [CiXIV 35] and a Malayalam-English Dictionary that is still in use [CiXIV 68]; among Gundert’s pioneering contributions there is also the introduction into Malayalam script of the use of the cil sign (˘) –ref. to article by Wiki-media people– and the differentiation between long "e" േ and short "e" െ. Moreover, his role as missioner brought him to translate the bible in Malayalam and other religoius text, such the books of psalms. Due to health issues he left India in 1859, and brought forward his research interests in the family village of Calw. </p>

<h2 class="ut-heading ut-heading--h2">The Gundert Legacy</h2>
<p>All Gundert’s interests are mirrored in his legacy: in fact, Gundert’s collection entails both grammars and primers as well as many religious texts. Yet, to frame the missioner’s intellectual enterprise within these two topic, would be a to misunderstand this great savant. He was trying to comprehend an entire culture, and not just bits and bites, and indeed in his legacy, we find also modern novels -such as the famous Indulekha [CiXIV 270-hyperlink to Dwork], considered, together with Kundalatā [CiXIV 137] the first Malayalam novel; in addition to the new developments of the literary production at his time, he collected also old texts of the Sanskritic and Malayali traditions– so much so that part of his legacy are, for instance, a copy of the Sanskrit text Vajrasūcī, with a Malayalam commentary [CiXIV36;36b], or the Kṛṣṇagatha [Ci], a well-known Malayalam traditional poetical narration of Kṛṣṇa life.</p>
<p>Kerala Pazhama [CiXIV 125b] (see Ullur IV, p. 164).</p>
<p>Among the Kannaḍa texts, there is the Bibliotheca Carnatica, a series of editions, initiated by Rev. Mögling, that was meant to encompass the most important works of the Kannaḍa traditions. The series was never finished, but the first 5 volumes entail texts that are fundamental to the religious and intellectual history of South India, as the Viraśaiva hagiography of the poet and religious revolutionary, Basava, the Cannabasava Purāṇa [Ci XIV 3.2-4 / CiXIV 3_fol-4] or the most popular Kannada adaptation of the Indian epic Mahābhārata, the Karnata Bharata of Kumāravyasa [CiXIV 3.2-3 / Ci XIV 3_fol-3].</p>
<p>A text that could be of great interest not only for linguists, but also for the scholars of religious and cultural studies are for sure the Latin-Kannaḍa / Kannaḍa-Latin Dictionaries compiled for the Missions in Mysore [CiXIV 117 and CiXIV 123].</p>

<h1 class="ut-heading ut-heading--h1">Numbers</h1>
<p>All together the number of pages run to roughly 42.800 pages.- This collection was re-discovered and identified in 1986. Almost all Indian manuscripts are rudimentarily described in the internal inventory –not always correctly.</p>
