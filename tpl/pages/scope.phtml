<p>The main aim of the project is to scan, catalogue and make publicly available printed and handwritten source materials from the estate of Hermann Gundert and his immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>The Gundert estate contains printed and lithographed books and pamphlets in Malayalam, Kannada, Tulu and Tamil, Indian manuscripts including several palm-leaf manuscripts, copies of texts and notebooks in various languages by Hermann Gundert and his missionary colleagues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all 19<sup>th</sup> century works in South Indian languages that are in the holdings of the University Library were included in the digitisation process, even if they are not strictly speaking from the Gundert legacy. English and German material written by Gundert and his closest colleagues was also added.</p>
