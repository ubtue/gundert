<p>844 prints, lithographed works, essays and manuscripts from the legacy of Hermann Gundert, enriched by some additional works about the South Indian mission of the 19th century from the language area of Malayalam and Kannada, were digitized and indexed.</p>

Through their mediation, many people could be found who produced on our behalf transcriptions of the printed Malayalam titles, so that a searchable full-text version is available for this part of the collection.</p>
