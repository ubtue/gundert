<p>More than <a>10,000 letters and notes</a> by Hermann Gundert to various addressees in the <a href="http://www.dla-marbach.de/en/archive/" target="_blank">German Literature Archive (DLA)</a> in Marbach/Neckar were transcribed by Dr. Albrecht Frenz a few years ago and could be incorporated into the portal. Together with the DLA we hope to digitize these letters in a future project.</p>
