This directory is a mixture of:
* vendor libraries provided by composer: symlinks to a substructure of /vendor/composer/... (like bootstrap, jquery and so on).
  * If /vendor/composer is missing, goto project root and run `composer install`
* vendor libraries customized for tubingen university, like the "ut" basic theme
