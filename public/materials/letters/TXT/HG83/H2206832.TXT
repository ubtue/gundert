An die Missionsverwaltung für Herrn J. Hesse in Leopoldshöhe, Baden

At 7 1/2 PM little Julie came running and announced: I have got a little sister. This must have happened about 7 1/4. We deliberated on the spot about the best name, but are still wavering between Barbara Emerentia and some others equally sonorous

 All well. Selams from V.
