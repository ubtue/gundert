Here a few letters! But nothing from Basle. One from Miss Bailey to my wife
is left here, as I expect her some time this day. Mrs Mc Alpin's daughter,
Mrs Garrard, died after her first confinement, a few days before Mc Alpin's
firstborn died at Aden. - We walked it very well, found the bandy in its
place and reached the good part of the road safely: but then what a rain
straight into our faces. All wet through, the boys shivering so I made them
run in the rain this side of the river; and the dinner schmeckte according-
ly. All well this morning. Hermann cried again for Mama. If she has not
left many Selams und schînen Dank fÅr alle Deine Liebe
