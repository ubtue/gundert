2 thank you heartily for the shirts you have kindly sent, last night Paul
had the three flanell ones. I fancy to see your dear Charles in them, Paul
like them they are broader than the ones of Frederic which he would not put
on,

I am sorry to hear your dear little one has still to suffer in the nose and
even in one eye dear Carle, kiss both for me, I think much of you these
days how you had one year before to prepare for the departure of your dear
partner. May the Lord who has helped hitherto keep and bless you with the
little ones. Give my special love to dear Marie Busser and her sister Mrs
W”hrle

                            Adieu dearest Marie
