It is already pretty long since I wrote you, I was glad to hear that dear
Chales is pretty well at least tolerabel.

Theodor was with me during church, he was very nice and brave; but our Dor-
le he does not like, it is good that he is not often with her.

So I send you your box that you may get work as you have none more! We send
also the cloth theodor got from Mrs. Herman from Liebenzel and all that
which is not necessary for Theodor. As you have taken an house you must
have all your things.

We wait anxiously for news from Frederic <(kamen Montag Vormittg)>611. How is
dear Mama Isenberg who had a catarrh I send her love as well as to Jetthen,
I hope you have a good time learning to look to the Lord alone and expect-
ing all from Him. With love and kisses to you three
