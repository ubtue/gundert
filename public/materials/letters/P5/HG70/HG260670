I hope that you could sleep on the way inspite of much talking, I hope far-
ther the catarrh has not return though it is rather cold today at least
here, we had rain yesterday which has coolled much, I regrette that you
have not a warmer coat,

Yesterday Paul felt less well then the day before, the night was as usual,
today he has headach and little fever, The Doctor sounded the woond, found
it rather deep and extended. He thinks also that it will last a pretty long
time, the bone is not affected but it lais very near, <"an einer kleinen
Stelle liegt der Knochen blo·" ->611

I spoke a little with Paul who is some what cast down without knowing what
the D said, he wish God woold make it short with him. The illness woold be
little troubel if he had peace and joy in the Lord. We have to wait and
with Gods grace we will quietly wait opon Him who has never failed to His
promises. I wish you a good time Try to hear something about Mrs Hoch eyes.
Love to all
