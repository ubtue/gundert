Many thanks for writing so faithfully and diligently. I wish I could give
you your fesperle; but I dare say if you would tell dear Mrs Hager she
would give you some bread and wine. I am at least glad that you have a good
dinner and I trust the Lord will so help and strengthen you that it will
not hurt you to sleep with some one in one room.

I am very sad to have no good news from dear Paul I trust to see him next
sunday. Tell us all about dear Mrs. Hoch and her family also about her Aunt
my good friend Miss Wasser who lives with her. Relate us also about the
dear Busser. Mrs. Steiger was astonished to hear that we had already three
letters from you, her son writes seldom. Dear son please send this letter
to her adress, I shall return you the centimes <das Comptoir solls fr mich
zahlen>611 you have to put upon it. We have incessant rain, the Nagold had
already last night began to overflow, the Seeger had to remove the things
out of their celler. The children were full of joy, but happily it did not
come too far on the road, at least I saw nothing of it.

Wednesday to day came your fourth enclosed in one to Mr Weitbrecht Many
thanks for it, I concluded that you were not well after your first from Ba-
le, you say in it that you do not feel quite well. Now I am very glad to
hear that you are trotz not withstanding the uncomfortable room and other
little disappointments, I am glad that you are pleased with your work and
do not find it to be too much.

Adieu dear Son
