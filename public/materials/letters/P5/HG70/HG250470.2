Forts.: <25 April 1870.>*
I thank you heartily for your kind letter which has refreshed my heart and
given me new courage to learn to wait upon the Lord, trust Him fully in all
things, Now I have to trust Him for my journey to Corcelles, where I go to
morrow D. V. I wish you to pray for me and Uranie that we may have grace
to speak to poor Fritz Fillinger who has just come from America. Uranie in
every letter sends you hearty love and even a book; but I did not give it
you, she loves you dearly. You know that poor Fillinger is 621a bad man, not
only drink much but lead even a bad life. pray for him

631Adieu mein liebster Paule. Es kÅ·t Dich Dein Friedr.
