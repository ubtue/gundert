Emma has already written to you how it is with dear Paul. I found her in
bahnhof were she told me that Paul had had a good night. I found him happy
looking nicely and stronger but it is the effect of the wine which he takes
gladly; on account of the great weakness, and it is almost the only thing
he can bear however he kept a plate full of sago soope at dinar time. As he
cannot take his injection alone I gave him one, I had scarsly given him
half a shopen that he felt much pain et could take nomore, since that he
has the crampes again he has no stool the injections even remain in the
body, he has troubel and pain to let water go out and it is dark red.

I shall remain here at all event till dear Emma returns from Laufen where
she goes next week for a few days.

As I have the good opportunity of sister Louise Zahn I send you this few
lines by her, I am writing by the side of Paul who sends much love. The Mi-
nister <Mast>* comes three times a day to see him, the Dr whom he asked
what he thought of his state ansewred that the evil is deep and compli-
cated, one cannot say any thing as yet. Now that he has pain he looks mis-
erabel and takes nothing at all, from fear to increase the pain. In the
midle of the woond is a small whole coresponding to the nose ear and
throught. When he keeps his breath pinching his nose the matters flow out
of that little whole.

                           More tomorow I trust
