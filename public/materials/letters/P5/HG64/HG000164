You put this blanket with the Scheet over you, than the red blanket over
the white and your plumon on the red tepich You need not change the Scheets
till the beginning of March till than I will write you. Only in March it
will not be cold so you schall send back the Scheet and blanket together
just as they are now the flanel is from papa but too small for him so it
will fit you well, as long as it is cold you must put woollen stockings

Here it is 2very very1 cold

Adieu dearest Frederic
