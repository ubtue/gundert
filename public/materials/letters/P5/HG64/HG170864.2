Forts.: 17 Aug 64
Only a word to greet you We were glad to hear of your early arrival. Noth-
ing particular here, except that the pair went to Liebenzell in the morning
met the Reihlens in the carriage on their way to Teinach; walked then to
Stadtpfarrer's, where Mary had completely forgotten the absence of the fa-
ther with his son (and he havg so kindly offered to take David too under
his wings) and Isenberg had forgotten that these were the same people who
had once kindly harboured him at Balingen. These kind people must have been
quite amazed at such an absence of thought!

Both returned for dinner. In the evening we went to Mrs W”hrle according to
what had been settled before. Fine things in plenty you may be sure. Marie
had indeed said they ought to make it simple, but at 4 o'clock in the aft-
ernoon when everything had been baked already.

The letter to Adolph Fried is to forward at his earliest opportunity.

Well I hope dear David is now (11 3/4) through the task of the morning and
may he be of good cheer and look up for what is still before him. It will
soon be over. Mr M”gling had exhorted him to pray the 27 psalm. Possibly
there is still time left for it.

Now farewell! love to all!
