Although I have not much to say I will use this opportunity to ask you to
bring for me a paquet which Mr Nast will give you; this paquet you shall
give 2to me and no body else1 if you have money enough you shall pay what it
costs to Mr Nast who will give you the paquet. Jettle will write about it,
tea and Merrettich you will also bring me; <hast doch die 10 Fl erhalten?>611

How are the dear people in Stutgart. I think often about dear Tante and Ma-

see you with your brothers
