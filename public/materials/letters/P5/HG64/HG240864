Forts.: [24.8.1864]
Many thanks for your two letters yesterday morning at 5 I was with you at
Calw and felt with you how difficult it would have been to separete from
Charles, but be sure this time of separation will be a good begining for
you both, to learn to wait upon the Lord, to be obliged to trust to Him
alone is a good preparation for His work, you will be driven to prayer much
more, and learn to look at the things before you Calmely. the fears when
letters do not comes at the time expected, that he is ill perhaps no more!
and how many other thoughts which will surely cross your mind and trouble
you; these fears and perplexites will work that which nothing else could
have done and so fit you for the work you desire to do, We all felt sad
this morning at the departure. Charles was quiet and well, dear Tante has
been most kind and lovely towards him, it is a real wonder how she devotes
herself.

I have no time more papa has told all about David <Landexamen 18/20 Aug>*
which is a great grief to me
