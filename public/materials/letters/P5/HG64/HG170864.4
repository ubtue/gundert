Forts.: <Aug 64.>*
Yesterday or this morning when tante and Frederic wrote one forgot to tell
Marie that she should tell the tailor when he works the trausers of Charles
to fold up much in side of every sewing he does, because in Indien through
washing all the sewing suffers much and comes out if the folding up is not
very deep. Emma herself has written about it how her things are already
getting spoiled and she is obliged to him again several of her things, by
the bit of paper here joined Marie can understand what I mean.

I have not yet seen Mrs Suskind, but perhaps soon, if dear Jettle had in
mind to come to Stutgard on Sutterday with you I would return soon or per-
haps Marie remains alone with Louise, just as you like I am quite ready,
David was at the examen from 7 morning till 11. he is as joyful and lively
as ever, cares not much, as he came out of the gigmnasium many people were
standing before it one lady is Charles Weise ready does he not come? David
with laughter said Do I know the boy? then some said he must have done well
this one else he could not so laugh. he teases every one here, in the Omni-
bus we had really rest only when he slept that s to say twice. He had a fa-
mous appetite took four pieces of meat at dinnar, he is rather displeased
at a few remarques I vendure to make him for his behaviour.

Now I must conclud, with love to all
