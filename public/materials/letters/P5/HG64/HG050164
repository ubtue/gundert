Forts.: 5th January 1864
All the news papa will tell you. I write only to tell you not to give too
many things to dear papa that he may not be troubled with them from the
house till the post

I was very glad to hear again from you and see that the Lord is gracious to
you and helps you through your difficulties; and when the devil comes to
trouble you with doubts and dark thoughts think that you can overcome all
these through faith in Jesus who Himself has been tempted in all things and
therefore can be a high prist for us feeling with us in all our tempta-
tions. Adieu my sweet dear Son Mrs. Wirz was here yesterday she sends you
love. Give my love to all

                              Yours affectly

Give your watch to papa to go to Kornthal that he may see the time and take
it again from Him.
