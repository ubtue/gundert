Only a few lines with a piece of Cake which David will give you along with
the key of your box; as for the oil it is not easy to send it. you should
buy a little till one has an opportunity to send it you, the boots I shall
soon send you. you have still two pairs with you.

I have not much time just now; therefore will excuse the few lines, when
you write tell also something about your health and about David, Give my
love to all the dear people.
