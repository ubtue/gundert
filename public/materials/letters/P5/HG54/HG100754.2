I send you the enclosed letters which report of our Br BÅhler's last day on
earth. The Lord be praised for all!

It is my intention to propose to Br Hebich and Diez, without delay to visit
the Nilgherries. Of course if Br Hebich is ready to go I remain. But I
think he will at all events stay some weeks longer. Would you kindly ask
Sandeman, at what time's notice bearers for a Manjil might be posted to Ca-
licut, and send the answer with the enclosed notes mine Drews and Stanes*
2to Hebich1
