What a length of time you left me without letter. I hope you now understand
all about the journey. Friday the 18th the horse ought to be in Tanoor,
ready to march back to Calicut on 2Saturday1. - Mrs B. will stay a week in
Calicut and some days at Chomb and Tell. - Mrs Lascelles is glad about Je-
suad<ial>* as well as her father who consents. I bring 10 Rs for her to
commence house keeping. I have excused you with the Lady. - M”glg is now on
his road to Bangalore. I am sorry for Francis and Joseph they are very much
in the dark and after so many warnings there is little hope for them at
present

Now farewell - Love to the Children, to whom I hope soon to write
