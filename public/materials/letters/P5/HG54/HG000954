Forts.: Sept 54
I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th of this
month. You ask me whether during my residence in Malabar I have heard of
instances of torture being employed for the purpose of realizing the reve-
nues of the state. In answer I have to state that during the 15 years I re-
sided on this coast no such instance has ever come to my knowledge. As the
Malayalis are not accustomed to suffer silently but generally make the most
even of trifling complaints, I conclude from their silence that such prac-
tices have not been heard by them: and I am confirmed in this view by the
fact, that tho' I have not often come into contact with Southern Malayalis
(from Travancore) yet have I repeatedly heard them complain of various tor-
tures being <had recourse to> in the collection of their pepper by the na-
tive government and they invariably wound up the tale of their grievances
with the fervent wish, that the Company might soon take possession of their
unhappy country.
