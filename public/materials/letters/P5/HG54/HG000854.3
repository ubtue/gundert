It is long ago since I got your last note but I have been a long time very
ill and could not write. Good Lord Jesus has granted again to me better
health and a little strength. I am very glad that you will go by and bye to
Europa, that will be good for your health. Sweat Paule will be a dear com-
panion to you on the voage. We do pray now dayly for you and the other
children who have to go home. After few years I shall send my Gottlob there
too and I am sure, you will be a very kind guide to him.

Let me know whether Paule is still talking of going to the Lord Jesus? tell
me also about David what he is doing. My Gottlob has now a cow of his own,
a Malasamudra cow, but no doubt, yours is a far superior one. Now dear Ed-
dy, plenty love to you and Brothers from Mr. Stanger and Gottlob and
chiefely from

.fo +
Your letter gave me great joy, I am glad you are so well and busy in pre-
pairing to go to Europa. I dare say you will then ...te forget me, but hwo
knows whether I shall not see you again there, and will then remind you of
your love and affection you showed once towards me. What is the matter with
sweet Paule that he thinks of fliing to heaven, is he not quite well? Ask
dear Mama, whether it will be useful for you and Paule to get nice, warm
Croche caps and comforters round your necks or if Mama can tell me of some-
thing else you want? I shall feel very happy to work anything for you both.
Mama shall be pleased to tell what I should work for you as soon as possi-
ble, and ask Missi to write to me about it when Mama does not feel well
enough to write. But please let me know very soon as I am often unwell and
want therefore a good long tim to work anything. How is dear David, can he
talk well now?

Give my love to both Missi, Kisses to Paule and David and salaams to all
the girls and people in the Compound.

With much love

Ever Your's affectionately
                                   Maam
