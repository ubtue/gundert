<(Nach lÑngerer Auseinandersetzg we·halb er und Minchin als cotrustees der
Casamajorschen Stiftung Moericke nach Kaity zurÅckversetzt wÅnschen):>

Your Society would be unworthy of the Confidence. Mr. Casamajor placed in
them, a confidence gained by the high charakter of the man (Moer) whom they
have removed, if he is not sent back to Kaity. ...621 Mr Moer. was highly
esteemed by Mr Casamajor, he is also highly esteemed by the Engl residents
on the Hills as well as by the Natives to whom he preached ...621 his removal
has been most injurious to the Mission (here) because he has a correct
knowledge of the language and character of the people - where as another
Missionary would be 2 or 3 years in requiring such knowledge and conse-
quently could be of no real service for that period. ...621

With reference to our dear brother 2BÅhler1 it is the united opinion of the
Physicians who kindly attended him, that his illness was occasioned by fa-
tigue in walking from Kaity to Kotergiri and part of the way back, about 24
miles, and their opinion being made public has caused much enquiry respect-
ing your Missionaries, the support they receive from your committee etc,
and I have heard many expressions of astonishment and indignation that your
Com. should be so indifferent to the temporal wants of their Missionaries.
Your Com. would do well to consider that their Mission is supported through
the instrumentality of their men, whose selfdenial, zeal and love have by
the grace of God won the hearts of Christians in this land, - they are men
who think their lives not dear so that they may win one soul to Christ. Yet
your Comm. appear to deal with them as hirelings compelling them to render
a daily account of the expenditure of the small allowance they receive, and
to give back any that remains of it, to the general fund, consequently
their minds are too often exercised in how they shall manage to live on
their pittance instead of being free in their Masters work.

Is not the Lord thus dishonored? and is not this the reason why your Mis-
sion is in debt? as appears by the last report just received. We see a
greater liberality in all other evangelical Missions and therefore the Lord
makes them to prosper.

I believe that many efforts would have been made by friends here for the
support of your Mission, had they not been discouraged by knowing the facts
I have stated.

I enclose a letter from Dr Scudder which I hope you will forward to your
Comm. - In conclusion I would entreat you to urge on your Comm. the neces-
sity of adopting a different system and more liberal measures for carrying
on the work of the Lord in India.

                   Ever my dear Brother affectioly yours
.fo -
                                                John Hodges.
