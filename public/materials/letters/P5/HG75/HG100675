My letter was already gone to Zug when yours arrived. I hardly think this
bit of addition sufficient for another, I had also written to dear Frede-
rick a little and suppose he does not want particularly our medical advice.
May his spirit be cheered and comforted.

You can leave Wildbad 5.30 in the afternoon, are at Brîtzingen 6.10 wait
there (or at Pforzheim from 6.15 - 7.15) till 7.19 and arrive here at 8
o'clock. We will assume that if you do not write again, you come 2here at 81
2o'clock1. I also think this better if you do not regret the hour in the
quiet Brîtzingen.

Elise remained the whole day in bed, but talked most cheerfully with her
people. I did not try to see her, lest she be too much excited.

Fred MÅller was here on his return from Nagold. I had to settle with Mrs
Zeller that I go there at 2.30 in the afternoon and farther to Altensteig
in the evening. From there we return Sunday evening to Calw but you must
not wait for us, we come after 10 and sleep. Monday morning you can then
talk with Mrs Ramseyer very quietly for hours.

Miss Th had today her first piano lesson with Miss Fecht.

Jette gives her orders and lessons, but I see little of her. You know that
Julie H and Emilie SchÅtz will accompany me to Bale So I wrote for them to
Frohnmeyer hope he settles it nicely.

Goodbye for the present With love to dear Uranie
