We were glad to hear again from you. Can dear Tine bath in your town or has
she to go far what qualities has the water she uses? I wish that her hands
be restored intirely and her body strengthened! You say that you are a lump
it is right: this knowlege you had not formerly; the more we advence the
more we see that indeed we are lumpen and wretched peopel, therefore we
learn to understand what is that be dead with Christ and burried with Him.
You got once very angry when we spoke of having to die, it was just before
your going to America. Now you begin to distrust yourself, your imagination
and wisdome and all that which you have and are, So that Jesus can take His
seat in your heart and rule guiding you from moment to moment, Be not dis-
couraged of doing nothing good, the Lord who has now his tempel in you
shall do the work, let Him only do with good confidence, May His word abide
in you, and fill you. Friederle does not find quite his present work so
smooth and easy as supposed For old age is bound and chained with customs
which form the second nature

Uranie sends you much love, she will soon return to her home

With hearty kisses to you four
