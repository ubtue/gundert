This is merely to show that I have so far come safely went as far as Pfzh
with Mr Gerber, at B. received by Ch W and J F who accompanied to M H where
I saw I. and Ko's <Kolbs>* without making farther visits. Was invited to
D<ettinger>* but preferred passing the evening with I I. Had Coffee in the
morning and F and D to come along to the gare nothing to be seen, mist the
whole way till I reached N where R waited for me. Saw all the 3 children
and their parents, also Amelie who invites to come to her tomorrow finished
my work so far, before 7 o'clock in the evening and am now ready to let
this fly off, before having proceeded to C.
