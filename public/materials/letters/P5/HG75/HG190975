Many thanks for your kind letter of 4 Sept, So dear Tini has been with her
daughters to Detroit. I hope they had joy and I hope to hear why dear Ju-
lia loved Lydia Traub; and so the protegÇ of your dear girls came again I
hope he may get something from them not only for the body; but also for his
spirit and soul. I trust that the bath will work on dear Tines hands and
the whole constitution. I write you but a few lines; for we have visits
dear Tante Reini with her Miss Robinson, the first was exceedingly glad to
hear your letters and she sends you hearty kiss One of her eyes is quite
lost; the other is weak she has to spare it; she is very nice she has also
been benefitted by hearing Pearsal Smith, she went to Hirsau to hear papa
today 19th The two last days I have got 15000 Torf for our winter; it will
amuse dear Tine to hear of so many and it was a great work to bring them up
on the soller. for the winter we have still to get potatoes which are this
year not good by us, we get some from Baden, then get wine from Alsace or
from else where the Autom is somewhat troublesome on account of the provi-
sions one has to store up, and still how thankful am I to be that we have
money to buy them all,

Now I must say Adieu with a tender kiss to you four
