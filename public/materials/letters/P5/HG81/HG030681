Joh hat einen schlechten Tag mit headache and does not intend to come to-
day. I saw him only at breakfast, he had slept very little and continued
after drinking his milk, with how much luck I do not know as yet I arrived
well, my Bhaltis was not very graciously received by Angersche. - Septuages
and Sex might perhaps be improved by adding "ungef„hr" (der 70ste und 60ste
Tag). Sir Walter Elliot will come to Wildbad and visit us, old Indian
strong in archaeology etc. Nothing new from Emma. Mama pretty well, up and
doing - Goodbye M W and all
