I do not think that you shd go to NB for the night, it gives trouble to the
good people. Rather go early Sunday morning and pass the day with them.
Here you may also see us at leisure Mama is pretty well, I getting rid
slowly of Schusshexe. Good bye for the present. Fred hopes to catch John on
his way to LÅb. somewhere. Send me also back or bring the letters of Herm
and Gust
