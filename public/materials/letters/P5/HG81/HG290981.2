Could you perhaps invite dear G MÅller (at Marquardts I suppose) to speak
here one evening? Saturday, Sunday, Monday etc he has only to chose for the
day. I of course go to Herrenbg where I have to preach and speak, but
others would be glad to have him. He may decide 2when1 he can and we shall
try to make it public
