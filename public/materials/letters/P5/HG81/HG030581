Got Your card and thank for news. Was at Heilbr with Jet Isbg, saw and
heard confirm of Thod and the catechis. in the afternoon. Charles much edi-
fied with the splendid dinner in which _________________________ was cre-
denced. We heard good news from B. (also at Heilbr.). I met in Zuff Josenh
who was going to Leonbg to see his very sick sister Weitbr and told him
that presents from Ind Christians waited upon him. They had first intended
to send him a coffin of Sandalwood, but were persuaded to think of some-
thing else. However it touched the old Insp. He had been at Gr Bottw. for a
feast after having worked hard for 4 days on occasion of his Umzug. I found
Ma really better, still cough going on. I intend to come the 10th. I never
hear what became of the Scotch Miss Record for El. Weitbr. I could have
given it here to Mrs Sch or her son repeatedly. When read I want it return-
ed.
