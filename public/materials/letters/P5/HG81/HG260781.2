Fried telegraphirt daá er heute (26) Nacht ankommt, von Jagstfeld - gestern
noch in Liegnitz. I keep the things for him that he see all before sending
off. I hope G. has come back. He told Str some time ago, that he is in in-
tercourse with a noble Lady, Str congratulated him for it because he
thought it most conducive to his spiritual health! What stories! It would
of course be much better if G had found somebody that undertakes to support
and guide him in future, but this is too good to be expected. - M has writ-
ten that she is better (suddenly ______ passed). She is in treaty with
Hauffs in Nufr about takg a young girl as help (not _____) in the family,
perhaps a _______. If that should not succeed, does any one know of some-
body else. Say for a year to help each other mutually. Mrs Reinhdt has lost
it seems a girl by a similar heartdisease as Herm's Tine. - Joh arrived
Tuesday at Reval, sees nothing like grief about the state of things, got
his books through. Hoped to be 11th at Weissenstein (11th = 23d it seems).
Goodbye with much love
