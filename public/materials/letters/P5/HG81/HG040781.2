C. 4th 6 1/2 P. M. Both well arrived. Met at Pfzh Miss Denner who reported
that Herm Kaund (I believe the one of 10 years) got the measles rather bad-
ly on the way from B. to WÅrtbg. Here greetings from all. Elisab with her 2
children met us at Hirs Peregr coming along. Fred and the others here Ö la
gare. The news that Ros. Kappler died last night it seemed to be a case of
typhus. The children all glad with the presents. Ma insisted on walking the
last bit to the house. Plenty thanks for all kindness. Here are the people
all full of the Creation given yesterday in a full house. Love to all Ad.
Memm. and Marulla with Katy and whoever asks after us
