service any day of this week or Monday following. I shall write tomorrow
to Mrs Mau. that I intend coming there. Here we had today la Cäne. Miss K
seems much better and ventures perhaps to go tomorrow. Thanks to J for his
names Mlle Lud. I found with M and v. Baumg. who all salute most heartily,
the latter thankg that you even intended to write. But Johnny dear do you
know that you and Feddy have made a mistake about the KÅndigung. That did
not refer to MM or Verl. V, but to the printer (if change for Jany, he must
be informed now; and the word K. slipped in Feddy's ear from Reinh to V.V.
No, for us there was no termin mentioned, but only that the gentlemen
thought KÅnd2barkeit1 a very essential condition). I hope Ad is really better
and continues so that I may hope to find her out of bed. But I am also rea-
dy to sit an hour with her and tell her of the Saentis which H Mglg ascend-
ed, or of Hanna Mannfld, born in Afr who is here with her father. Other
children there are also but they donot come near. If I can I shall salute
also Mr W. Goodbye for the present Love to all from your ____________
