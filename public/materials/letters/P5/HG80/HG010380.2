Your card arrived Saturday night. I had ...611 written to Mrs Bl the day I
received her telegramm. ...611d my remaining at home. But I am better, ...611
Thursday came the Isbg sisters with whom ...611t out to see the Logis of-
fered to them. It was her first walk and gave her inflammation of the wind-
pipe, so she lies still, but with diminished fever. The little one is look-
ing up. Today <1 MÑrz>* her 2d large ________ was opened and a mass of mat-
ter came out, she did not cry when it was done, but seemed almost suddenly
relieved. Fancy the inflammation in the bronchia emptying itself behind in
the thighs! At Hirsau yesterday I related of Bl. since I made his acquaint-
ance Nov 29; and what I knew of God's dealings with him. Many hereabout
feel his loss deeply. Goodbye
