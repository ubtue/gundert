letter to E. I do not see cause sufficient for sending it. I am agst
Kdbrkt621, i.e. I wish that the change if effected be complete. Therefore I
have not mentioned it in the paper drawn up for Sch. I mentioned the 3000
instd of 4000 and fancy Kzl understood me fully and intended to stand up
for our view. If 2they1 add some thg abt Kdbrkt I can enter upon a correspdce
on the subject but do not see that 2we1 have to commence talkg abt it. Dear J
seems to doubt as to what my views are, but I think they are so far plain.
I can wait quietly to hear what is resolved, and if there is a wish to meet
us halfway we shall do the same. Nat. Fr. etc very nice; I have no inten-
tion of going to B to influence the decision, Sch thanked me that I was
short in my speeches on the subject lest it appear as if we had forced the
matter thro'. Thankful that Ad is better With love from Mrs M to Mama etc
