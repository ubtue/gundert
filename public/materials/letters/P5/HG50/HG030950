Here is the goldwatch - the new spring cost but 1 Rup (for us). I hope it
goes well. I send with it Mrs Cummins last for yesterday afternoon it in-
duced me to hold the first Malayalam service (an "i pay") after more than a
year. I baptized Samuel's Phinehas who was born only 7 days ago and seems
dying of convulsions. Mrs C. went along with me to the sickroom. So I thank
God for having tried so much without injury to me. We do not hear from
M”glg for a long time indeed. He will now be at Bangalore. Sham R is going
on to my satisfaction, very anxious to learn and asking about all he does
not understand. I hope he will be a faithful servant in his line.

Love to my children and I send them here some pictures! May peace be with
you and
