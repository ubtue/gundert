Forts.: 22 July 50
In the hope soon to hear again from you I write you again a few lines. The
weather is today so fine - it is Heb's day to Anjerc. that I think you will
be very much tempted to send the horse. You may do so if this continues a
few days. Then I beg you to let Missy seek some bundles of "Schwaebischer
Mercur 1848 und 1849" - They would interest dear M”gling. There is a bit of
Jany 48 then chiefly March April May June (July?) - of 1849 only Jany -
May. This to be packed together for the horsekeeper perhaps in some wax-
cloth. - I am going on famously - codliveroil morning and evening and plen-
ty of water with the Dr's permission. Heb has written a flaming letter to
the Dr to take me entirely into his hands I am much beholden to him for so
kind a care for me. But in Manjesw. especially I had in prayer a very com-
fortable assurance that the Lord will now soon make me well. I speak al-
ready better 2says the Dr1 than I did when he saw me at Cann. Perhaps even
the shaking which for the moment annoyed me such must have contributed to
unroot the evil. Still we shall go on slowly - I am now dear M's amanuensis
(= secretary) and have heard that Gottfds. are very well hoping for the ad-
vent of ...611 Mrs Greiner's Rickele was dangerously ill on Saturday night
from inflammation of lungs. They had kept the house too much shut to avoid
the Monsoon air, and Mrs Gr. herself said once it was now like a cellar.
They quickly brought the child up on Sunday morning - and it recovered. As
it was exactly the death day of their Hermann the fear of the parents may
easily be imagined. Now it seems to go all well. - Mrs Lascelles writes
kindly to M”gl gathering Money for the Mission etc and has brought her
husbd so far as to give 20 Rs per month for themselves. - Now may peace be
with you and the children
