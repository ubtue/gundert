Only plenty Selam with the grasscutter, whom you will order to take the
goats tomorrow. I trust you are all well. You will not know perhaps that
Chirutas Isaak <(11 Apr)>* (Thomas) has been taken away by the Lord. She
bears it well and I believe will profit by it. And now with kisses to the
children farewell
