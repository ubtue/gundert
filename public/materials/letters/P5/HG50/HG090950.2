I am sorry you should have taken amiss your Moonshee's absence, as I see no
reason to doubt the excuse he gave for it. We wished that he serve you the
full time stipulated and could not feel at liberty to encourage any devia-
tion from his engagements without your consent. We may perhaps find a suc-
cessor for him that may suit you, but I should say from my experience that
men warranted never to absent themselves are rare in these parts.
