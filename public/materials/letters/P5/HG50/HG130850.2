Forts.: 13 Aug. 50
Yesterday evening the steam letters arrived - none for me, yet a good deal
of news. You will have heard that Sir Robert Peel is dead - what a loss!
But I will not quiz you on your indifference to Politics. Barth wrote from
the Basle Anniversary, that there are more visitors than there were for
some years. He had visited the Mission girls at Gundeldingen, now 10 in
number. Krapff from Eastafrica related plenty of his stories. Sutters fa-
ther in law made the nonsensical question if Missions may be undertaken in
Africa and China because Christ when speaking of the world meant as in Luke
1 only the Roman empire - what a nonsense! Josenhans gave good answers.
Lehner goes to America and holds the farewell speech in the Mission garden
- A fine man Plebst is to come as printer. He was studying for a Miss[ion-
ar]y when the Dr had to order him for his health to return rather to handi-
craft. Professor Munier from Geneva was also at the anniversary. Poor Stan-
ger still writes thundering letters threatening to expose Kies etc as well
as our Committee in the Newspapers. - Kinloch attacked our Mission in the
Madras Spectator - Mîgling was about to give some answer, but Anderson dis-
suaded him from it, because he feared Kinl. might become irritated to pub-
lish all sorts of stories as produced by Cannanore tittle tattle. - They
have put an Ultimatum to WÅrth, that if he go not to Mang he be dismissed.
So it is well that he came before this arrived. To Mîgl. he says that he
never had any private feelings against him and that he is happy at Manga-
lor. But it appears that he and the others in the Oberland have made ex-
tracts of all Mîgl's letters and sent them to the Comm. in order to show
how wicked a man he is. This is only discovered now by letters from home,
which reproach Mîgl. for not sending also the letters of the brethren to
which those extracts were the answers. Though Hoffmann till the very last
did all to help those in the Oberland and to oppose Mîgling, the brethren
in their letters home are now throwing stones after Hoffm and tell the
rudest things of him. This afflicts the Comm. very much. But Josenh. is de-
termined to maintain his authority. - Greiner is not quite well these days.
He seems to suffer in the lungs - not much, but so as to make a change de-
sirable. This day he spends on Balmatha Degg having returned from Utchila
to relieve him. - Mîgl. is packing, he sends his things off today, and
Thursday evening he departs in the Manjil. I am glad to see him move at
last, it seemed as if he could not get away from his work. - We hear just
now that Sanderson cannot come to meet M. at Mercara as promised, because
he expects Mr Groves to stay some days with him. I suppose it must be John
Groves, as Norris is with his sons. Mîrike is also perhaps prevented from
seeing M at Mysore. BÅhler who offered to come and talk about the hill af-
fairs, is offended that M. will have no talk about business, and tho' Mîri-
ke had the permission of the brethren to go to Mysore, it has been in a
manner withdrawn because there is no money to spare etc -

Nath. writes continually to his wife, to keep well each letter of his: I
hope you do the same and what is more steal none of those I formerly re-
ceived from you. Or - wait only what I shall do! Hoch and Mîgl send Selams
to you also Mrs Gr. I hope Francis is well again - tell David how anxious
Mîr. is to hear good news about him give him also my love as to Jacob Jo-
seph and the others great and small, poor and rich etc not forgetting Miss
Kegel, nor above all my two Bavas Frederick and Vau!
