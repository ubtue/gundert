Yesterday eveng I received your home letters, a mighty big present, for
which accept my best thanks. Of course I take them for a letter to me: and
even for a good one - everything is just in time. This evening they will be
sent to the Post. - I quite agree with all you wrote. Two points I do not
understand "voisins qui 2depuis1 sur le mur - epient le temps" is that = des-
sus? The other is "chere Marie et moi sommes gardiennent par tour" Is this
verb 3 pers. plur. or participle? But other wise the letter is written with
a great degree of accuracy. Veuil (instead of veuille) prochin for prochain
… (for a) Unice (for Eunice) etc. are points which I have corrected. The
girls made several mistakes f. i. 6 Oct 1848 for 47 I wrote Conoren without
x: such at least is my impression from former letters. - I am surprized the
Comm. sent that order to Marie: for I wrote never anything to that effect.
She must have caused it herself by reporting that I wished her once to re-
port about the school and that she did not think it her duty, or whatever
she may then have written. I for my person shall not write to the <Frau-
en>*Committee, until Sarasin writes to me directly: but I will do all in my
power to give our own Comm. every news of the school. - M”gl. dictates to
me a history of the purchase of Kaity: but it does raise his pulse to 99
per minute.

Gottfrd has begun his meetg in the chapel. The Colonel sent plenty of drum-
mers bandboys etc and they expect a real blessing on it. The English will
illuminate the Chapel on those evenings. Gottfd preaches on the Galatians -
Yesterday evening M”gl held his meeting - very fine. Maltbys are present.
It would be a pity to let it fall to the ground when he goes. I sang with
the Dr out of the same hymnbook - a great surprise to him to hear my voice!
Mrs Foulis not quite well. Lehm. will soon come, we think. Gottfd thinks
him a very vain brother, but Pauline thinks better of him. In love

Selams to my boys: and let them continue to sing from all their heart!
