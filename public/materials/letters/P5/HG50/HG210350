Forts.: <21 Mrz 50>*
As I intend to complain before the Tahsildar of an assault made on my guest
Dr Graul, a German traveller, and my self by some Nairs, I think it my duty
to acquaint you at the same time with the circumstances.

On Dr Graul's wish to see the Valiapatnam fort I set out with him yesterday
evening on foot. When we came near the temple before the fort, some Nair
youths followed us very close and could not be induced to leave us alone.
However they kept within certain bounds confining themselves to hypocriti-
cal assurances of their submission and scoffing at our religion, whilst we
took no notice of them. But after we had left the fort, when passing before
the temple Calari Vatukel, a number of Nairs stood drawn up near the en-
trance pouring down their abuse on us and encouraging our followers to come
to blows. Accordingly 3 of the youths grew bolder whilst the others went
away. One tried to seize Mr Graul's umbrella, the other soon after threw
the first stone at his back. Then we remonstrated and they retreating to
some distance commenced throwing stones and vociferating till they had
quite infuriated themselves and thus pursued us till near our house. Happi-
ly the heavier stones did not hit. One running after me gave me a blow over
the right arm with a branch he broke from a Cashoonuttree. I need hardly
remark that we did nothing to provoke them neither retaliated in any way.
Not even in a remoter way have I ever offended them having been prevented
by illness from outdoor work ever since my arrival at Chiracal, a circum-
stance to which themselves alluded when deriding our persons. Those whom we
called for witnesses, slunk out of the way and thus enabled them with the
help of the increasing darkness to continue their play so long.

Acquainted as I am with the growing impudence of these people which already
at times renders it a task to take a morning or evening walk, I cannot help
feeling that if they be left unchecked the consequences may yet become more
serious. I trust therefore you will if need be stimulate the exertions of
the native officials for the discovery of the offenders

                        with every regard I remain
