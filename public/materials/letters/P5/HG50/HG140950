Forts.: 14th Sept <50>*
It is today the 14th Sept and tomorrow our brother Adolph is to be confirm-
ed. Theodor also will then pay a visit at Stuttg. So they will have a fine
day of it, and they wish us to remember them particularly on this day be-
fore the Lord. - Yesterday the steamer passed by here and gave us the News-
papers but no letters of importance. Hoch had one from his parents they
hope he may succeed in his wishes. No news from the Mission house. Yours of
the 10th arrived just when sending off my last - I hope Missy is well by
this time and that she will try to keep well - better fasting than taking
much medecine! - I only told Nath that his boy began to teeth and trouble
his mother. The horse is just unwell, they say he had also fever in ascend-
ing the Ghauts under Mîgl's load. I hope a few days will suffice to restore
him.

I do not wonder much about the mishap that befell David <Sany>*. Poor fel-
low! May he learn to distrust himself and begin to believe in the power of
the Holy Ghost! - I had written to Mîr. some of your details concerning
him. Now he says, his private view is, that a marriage might perhaps help
him on, and cure him of his Dharma thoughts, but he does not know what
their conference would say to it. - Buhrer will now stop till Nov 1851. He
is still not 2quite1 recovered, suffering now and then from pain in the stom-
ach. Of Buhler he mentions that yesterday the ice broke between them, that
means that they will have a warmer season now. - Lehm. seems to be exceed-
ingly well pleased with Ammann and his whole situation there. Hoch returned
from a visit he had made with his boys to Utchila and Mulky. Ebenezer walk-
ed it very well and is to describe these four days for the benefit of his
sisters I wonder if he will also write down that he got some raps for never
covering his head when walking in the sun, be it in the very noontime. -
They say that Deane will return to Cannanore when he has served his time on
the hills. - Graul has answered at last "he sends allerherzlichste GrÅsse
an Sie alle, Fraeulein Kegel nicht zu vergessen, und noch unsern freund-
lichsten Dank fÅr alles Gute was wir in Ihrem Hause genossen. Ihr ergeben-
ster K. Gr" He learns Tamil and will now preach once in it. Then he goes to
Ceylon. I hope you are still keeping up your patience. poor Pauline wrote
