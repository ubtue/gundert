I hope you will be so much pleased with the inside as hardly to wish for
any addition. But I have still one bit of news more. Mîgling is much bet-
ter, makes walks of 7-8 miles, sits 6 hours with the Committee members, and
bathes 3 times per day. A Bath in Bang. he says is something specifically
different from one in Mang. He was weighed at Palhally by the Groves - 230
______. He is much pleased with Miss. Cryer, a simple Wesleyan Missy - as
for Garrett he could wish to have him for the press and other work of the
kind, he is a great genius in that sort of business, but their Miss[ionar]y
prospects not much better in 1850 than in 1843

WÅrth has today gone with the big boys to Bolma, the Catechist station
South of the Mang river.

___Brief schrieb.

Lieber Bruder

.fo +
Dem HErrn sei Lob und Dank jetzt ist Alles vorbei! wir haben seit gestern
Abd 9 1/2 Uhr ein gesundes 2starkes KnÑblein1 - Pauline had 2long1 pains but
not particularly strong ones. she was in pain exactly 24 hours 2before1 the
water came away - and then 2two1 hours more. The child came very quickly and
surprised us all by its lusty cries. It is large and well made. After the
birth P. enjoyed nice rest - (occasionally she had also been able to sleep
a little between the pains - but had had much trouble also from vomiting
etc) but the afterbirth was troublesome - the Dr waited 27 hours1 and then
took it away. There was an adhesion about the size of 1/2 Rupies. Now thank
God even the last piece of business is over and P. is put to bed - and
sleeps I trust comfortably at this moment. Mrs MÅller has been with her
last night and Mrs Albr. the night before. both very kind. The Dr says ev-
erything is right now. P. lost not 2too1 much blood -

The child is to be called Charles Christian Hartmann like my father - so
receive it into your 2avuncular1 affection and also pray for it and its moth-
er. Tell Hochs and all Balmatthe of our joy and give our special love to
dear Julie.

                           Yours ever most affly
                                                   GW.

Please packe die andren Briefe ein und schicke sie fort - den an Mrs Gr.
