as to old Indian friends who may be in or about London I recommend my two
sons Frederick and David Gundert who are about paying a visit to England,
being associated with me in my work, for any services their kindness may
prompt them to show to younger pilgrims on the same road which the fathers
trod.

With Christian regards
