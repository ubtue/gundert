Forts.: <29/6/78>
Accompanied by MÅller newly returned ...621 and Mercara I passed from Carlsr
to B...621 then alone to Delsbg. In the morng till ...621der. Ur. received me
and said that Fred. h...621 morng for Chateau d'Oeux, J had an attack of ...621
Choleralike at Corc. Thursd, she managed ...621 to N. but felt already that
farther travellg was out of question. Even today though all is much better
there is no possibility of leavg the house. She rests on the sofa, is very
quiet and awaits the decision from me. Before tomorrow Mond we certainly
cannot travel and when we do it, we must divide the task carefully <she
says no - go in one hurry>. But why speak of what is future! She is thank-
ful for a very good night. Goodbye. Love to all
