Forts.: 18th Nov 78
The good warm kiss of dear Emmale has reached us safely and has been re-
cieved with great joy. I send her one too as hearty I trust as hers was.
also to dearest Tine and your two dear daughters of whom we like always to
hear much.

Today I feel very tired having had much to do the last days, preparing the
things for Nelli <Stoton>* who went away today, She had become so negligent
that all her things had to be mended, We thank God for having opened a door
for them both, perhaps they will learn better than they did with us, the
eldest is a sad caractere, untrue and proud.

We are glad for you in this winter to think you have more room and more
comfortable. May the Lord give you joy in the congregation in which you
work so patiently

Adieu dear Son with love from Uranie to you all and from

                               Yours aff JG.
