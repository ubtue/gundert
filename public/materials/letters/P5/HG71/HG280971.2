Your last letter to papa has rejoiced me much. a broken heart and a con-
trite spirit is really that which we want, in such a state we are truly
happy and thankful, Oh could we see the long suffring and patience of our
Lord toward us, how melted and tender would we be The knowlege of His great
love can alone give us a feeling of thankfulness and inabel us to love all
His children tenderly. If His love is revealed to us by the spirit how does
it change all in us, we are then ready to do any sacrifice for Him and
there is but one sigh within us oh for more knowlege of Him who is love, to
know Him is Eternal life, in Him we have life and when He shall appear we
shall also appear with Him in Glory, now live from Him, to Him that's the
secret which we have to learn daily and by which we can say gradually I
live not I but Christ lives in me. With hearty love to you both
