I was glad to hear that your health is better and that the summer arange-
ments shall suit you better. In your last you say nothing of Steigers
health, here one knows nothing of it, his sister has an opportunity to mary
a schoolmeister. whether she will have him one does not know, she is some-
what high minded, for How long shall you have leave to remain here after
the feast? Uranie who intends to come, might perhaps return with you if you
remain 4 or 5 weeks!

I must say Adieu having to write to her too

                                 With love
