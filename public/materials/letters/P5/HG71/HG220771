I have paid a visit to the minister I like her very well, she has invited
you to dinner with the Missionary Ilk <Illg von der Brem Miss.>611 who are to
come too, on tuesday One drink caffe in her house and after the preaching
or the meeting being over, sitt behind the church. Are perhaps the Ilk com-
ing with you but it would scarsly be room enough! for us all

I beg my dear Marie not to forget to send me 5 paquet handkerchieves or fi-
chu for the tow boys and the little Mariely. if you find anything better
than tÅhcher do what you think right only it must not exceed 42 cr allto-
gether.

I like the ministers wife more than him, <(Pfarrer? von Wildbad) or den
stutzermÑ·igen Mîricke von Calmbach?>* I had a curious visit this morning a
lady sent by Miss Reutern, her name I cannot say she is born Bieneman Jett-
le will know perhaps, She has been every where with Blumhardt, Trudel,
strict Lutherans, now with Methodists, a soul driven about without rest,
and still teaches others where she finds hearers, it is curious how many of
those Russians nobel peopel cannot find or remain in the simplicity of the
Gospel. This one runs away from her husband and children, her head must be
wrong along with the heart. It is good to be obliged to work, it keeps one
from many evils and errors,

With hearty love to you all
