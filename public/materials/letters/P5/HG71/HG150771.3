It is all right about Mrs. M”g., Mrs M”rike can always find something for
them, just now it is very full, the heat brings many peopel. Till now one
based aonly every two hours; and the basins were not full; but now they are
open every hour,

Much love to dear David I have no time to write him, as I take the next
post to let Jettle know where are your badhosen. We are going to walk be-
hind the church where there is a fine walk, and less peopel than in the
