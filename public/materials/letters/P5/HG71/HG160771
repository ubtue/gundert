Many thanks for your kind note, I thought you would have no time to come to
this place, I trust the Lord gives you out of His fulness, so that you have
a good day.

So my dear Frederic has <15 Juli>* come. I shall have the joy to see Him on
the 25th when he shall I suppose accompany Papa to the Mission feast, then
we shall D.V. return together to Calw. Uranie is nicely so we did not go to
the Dr

I have comunicated your letter to Mrs M”rike who is very intimate with the
dear M”glings, she hopes to find a convinient room in the school, nice lo-
gis are rare as of late more peopel came to this place. Mrs. Morike was
astonished that one had not asked her directly. She seems to be very close
with Mrs. M. So I am rather glad not to have the responsibility of choosing
a room as one has little choice.

As I have an opportunity to send this I do it, shall write after ward about
a logis if Mrs M”rike does not prefere do it herself. Much love and thanks
to dear Marie with her dear sons A kiss to my dear son Frederic As I will
go to Church I conclude

                        With love yours afftly J.G.
