You are getting rich in photographs, the likenesses of great many. The one
of the Lord you are to keep in view not in a picture; but portrait before
you as discribed by St Paul in Philli 2 ch 5-9 I find nothing so difficult
as to fix my mind on the Lord and Paul says that we should know Him, studdy
Him, that's the only way to become like Him, We want more of the Holy Spir-
it to reveal us our Lord and create in us a longing after His image rework-
ed in us or reestablished in us.

I am glad to hear that you find your task easier, Adieu dear Son
