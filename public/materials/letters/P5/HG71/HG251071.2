It seems to me a pretty long time since we heard from you, however I hear
always indirectly about your health and work, I would not like to have so
many visits as you seem to have continually, but having no school you can
attend better to the other duties,

Do you know any thing about Sister Diez, is she ever writing to you, has
she never acknowlege to have been wrong towards you?

10 days ago your brother with his bride were here for a few hours, they
should have come sooner but Albert remaind esleep so that his bride had to
wait in Zuffenhausen some hours where they had given rendezvous! She pleas-
ed us well, something natural, upright active about her, evidently well ac-
customed to work, Albert appeard to the same as ever.

I fear the poor wife shall get a hard life as poor dear mama had, however
the Lord can change him. Our house is again lively since the boys have re-
turned. With love to you both
