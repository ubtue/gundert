Sunday good morning Dearest Frederic

I hope that you get a good day with the Lord with His word which is the
food and life of our souls; we want, but hunger and thirst after, than we
shall be filled. These days I felt happy by the thought or words of our
Lord "Care for nothing; because I care for you" Could we but believe how
happy would we be under all circomstances The day of tomorrow shall care
for itself so I have to think only for today, and if I have my Lord present
with me what can be my cares, He cares for me, all His promises are for me,
the text I had on new year too, that is open thy mouth wide I shall fill
it. So that we can say with st John we have the petitions of our hearts.
Yes dear son, cares for our daily work for all that which concerns us, the
most minutes things He cares for us. We must believe and live with Him He
shall fulfill His words

                             Adieu my dear Son
