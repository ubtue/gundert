Many thanks for your note, you have fine weather for the wash About P night
shirts I am in no hurry, at the end of next week or so, but send only the
shirts which are marked PG or FG, not the ones of papa which are big and
marked G. or H. if there are not 4 or 6 of P or F than make up the 4 or 6
with some very old of papa, 4 will also do Yesterday Mrs SÅ·kind was very
nicely, takes much interest in Paul, by your letter just recieved, your
wash is going on well. Grandmama has also wash next monday

Give my love to all those who ask after us, specially in the house up and
down Tante has a severe cold perhaps Gripe; but she does her work cooking
these weeks as Gmama has wash and cleaning, her Meenely leaves her the
first March to go to Lausane.

Adieu Jettle, many hearty thanks for all your troubel
