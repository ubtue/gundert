I thank you heartily for the few lines which you have kindly sent me. I
have seen Mrs Moerike, who sends love to all, she is well and happy in her
work, in her house I met Mrs Helfer Egge or Hege from Stutgart, she has a
girl with Mrs M she herself lives in our vivis with Statd Pfarer; This
morning I met also on my walk The mother of our Mr. Pfleiderer from Weib-
lingen, she seems to be a nice person, Wildbad is not so full as one would
have expect, but if the weather remain fine more peopel may come, Till now
the bath does not try me; but Mrs. Moerike says that it comes afterward.
Have you no news about Mariea? salute her from me please Rikele too, also
Dorle Kruner,

What are doing the two dear boys, when ever children play near the house
Uranie fancy to hear Theodor and Carl. She likes this place very much and
she is prety well, But it is to me a curious life, much love to my dear
daughter and to Emelie as to all in the house
