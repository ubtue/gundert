I would have sent you a few lines per post to wish you a blessing on your
birthday; but as Miss Busser is going to Bale to morrow I wait for the op-
portunity to send you a piece of cake and a portfeuil from dear Paul,

Please tell us how is your health are the boils diminishing? Since you left
Papa has not been well, he had an inflamation of the throat with much fev-
er, could not eat nor speak without pain. He is thank God somewhat better;
but not well as yet,

Marie tells you I suppose how beautiful was the illumination, papa and my-
self did not go out of the house to see,

yesterday evening the Decans were here for supper, Jettle is still in Stut-
gart; shall return Thursday. David writes seldom he may have to go to Ulm.

It seems to me that you have not written since pretty long Adieu dear son
May the Lord bless you and make you really happy in Him, If the pardon of
our sins and the love of Jesus is present and dear to us, than we can be
happy, but these things must be fresh and great before us, then all others
appear small and of little value compared to this,

                       Now Adieu my dearest Frederic

                                      yours affectly J.G.

Did you sent my letter to Uranie?
