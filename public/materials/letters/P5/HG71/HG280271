I trust you are getting some rest in Stutgart and that your dear Aunt is
not worse. Till now we have had so many visits that we had but little rest,
yesterday I had Mina Laure to sew. On sunday Frederi Marie and myself went
to the Lord supper papa kept at home having a cold.

I thank you dear Jettle for all the troubel you had during my absence, Fre-
deric left this morning, We hear that Lotte Buhl is very ill in Diaconiss
hause she was sent back from Tubingen with nervous fever.

If you see some of the dear people who helped my Paul give them please my
love as well as to those who remember us; but special love to dear Mrs.
SÅ·kind, May the Lord give you a happy time together

                             Adieu dear Jettle
