Forts.: [Oktober 1871]
I thank you very much for having taken the troubel to write with such let-
ters that I could read.

I was half afraid after dinnar that dear Marie was unwell as I did not find
her at the post. I trust our Lord will soon restore her to health again;
but she should at all event, not venture to leave Stutgart too soon as it
might hurt her. The Children are cared for they live in our room, and the
baby is really delightful, plays alone, sings most part of the day. On sun-
day it was so wet that we kept Theodor at home the whole day, once he said;
but why can I not go on the street; however he was contented to play with
Carl. Be not anxious about your little ones, nor about your lessons. May
the Lord bless you and bring you back healthy in His time.

You were invited to take tea to day with Mrs. oberamtman. I have of cource
sent word as well at your schoollers.

I trust dear Mama Isenberg is not too anxious and is kept from headach.

With love to each of you and kisses
