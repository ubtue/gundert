without Louisele excuse me please. She is delighted to go and see on her
way her friends in Eslingen. She will tell you all ne news of our house,
and what a busy day was last saturday the two Rikes going away at once so
that Louisele put forth her knowlege and wisdome, and she did very nicele I
was glad to have her till the new Rike came back, to day they have both
cleanse your sitting room, one could not have sent her to Boll today not
time enough. With love to the dear peopel there kisses to dear Charl and
yourself
