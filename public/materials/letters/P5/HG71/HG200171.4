Many thanks for your kind note I do not think that papas oven wants to be
clean as yet, but if it does not give heat you may have it done, Si l'hor-
loge n'est pas remontÇ a temps c'est possibel que ca derange la sonerie,

Give my love to Rikele and to all in the house Emelie Dorle etc. Is Mrs.
Scheffel returned?

Dear Paul is pretty nice wishes at least to be kind and friendly. Miss
Shott sends you hearty love I meet her often as we are in the same departe-
ment, while I seldom see Clara Feltweg.

How is Mrs WÅrz, Wîhrle, Theodor H. What with the Decan? Does perhaps Elise
know some thing of the little girl Charriere in BadgassÇ?
