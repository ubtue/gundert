Paul remains here, but he wishes 2much1 to see Marie and children; so she
should bring them, perhaps monday if she can, I slept here as Paul was very
miserabel yesterday evening, the night was better than I had expected, he
is of course weaker, but can still live some time. he is happy in the Lord,
and look for the home above contendes
