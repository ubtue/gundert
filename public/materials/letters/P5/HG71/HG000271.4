Many thanks for your kind note I feel quite at rest here as you are at home
with all the troubel I am very sorry that you must have the wash alone; Let
Rickele buy 4 four pound of smierseif and two pounds of good soap to boil
the clothes, pieces to wash you will find in the top of the Almira in the
corner of my bed room. each woman becomes a bottle of white wine a loaf of
two pounds, half a quarter pound of cheese for fesper; but I think Rikele
knows already, and Mrs sheffel can tell you all, only please do not give
yourself so much troubel the three women can well finish, even help to hang
it up. each get 30 Cr for one day.

I have just seen Mrs. SÅ·kind who is better she can walk in her room and
shall be glad to see you for some days when you can; of course after the
departure of P.

My love to all those who think of us,

                            Yours affectly J.G.
