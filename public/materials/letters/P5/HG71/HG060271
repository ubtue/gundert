I have nothing in particular to write but will send you the letter of dear
Uranie, who is anxious to hear from you, but has your letter since Satur-
day. Jettle says that Dorle Gruner has now a good time. We are all well.
Dear Carle comes often to Jette or me, wanting us to play with him, which
of course we cannot do long. Plenty love from us all Ever yours in J Chr.
