Yours I received Friday eveni for which accept my thanks. Why I still write
you will soon find out as I have always some petitions Hebich has brought
me no Cambely from Payavur as I expected none were to be got; but Jacob
tells me that the coorg country is the right place for blankets white and
black I would then beg you to let Nani inquire and if cheap buy 24 or 30 -
At the feast people were very quiet but few people comparativly would here
Jacob spoke with the father in law of Stephanas your new convert and with
many other coorg men they were all engry at the steps of Stephanas they al-
so said that he has about 12 or 14 hundreds Rs detts which will bring him
to trouble as peope wish by all means to trouble him. I am anxious to hear
how you are going on there and how he has been received.

Yesterday in chapel all people asked after you. Mrs Young paid a visit sat-
urday evening. Cpt Carr has promised one for this evening. A young officer
<Newbery 19 Febr>611 has died I foget the name. Griffith <the chaplain>* was
with him nearly the whole night. Gomperts <Gompertz>* was too. the Chaplain
said before many officers who were standing near the sick one here is a
calling for every one of us to seek salvation before it be too late. Though
the dying had had a steady life very high church man he said before his
companions to a question about the hopes of his soul. I have no hope of
salvation. I have trifled too much with religion. Many young men are shaken
among whom Mr. Gray who already one came to chapel before. Now I will fin-
ish my scribble. We are thank God all well.
