I regret that there should be anything calculated to annoy you in the con-
nexion which has been lately formed between ourselves and some men of the
74th. <When you came down we expected that all the Presbyterians, at least
those of the established Kirk, would go to attend on you. Mr Hebich thought
even of proclaiming from the pulpit, that he was prepared for this step and
left it with them to do what seemed right. He was prevented from thus
meddling with the matter by the consideration>621 As we have done nothing to

attract them we judged it but also during your visit not to interfere in
the least with their movements - but just to continue, as we had begun,
ministering to whatever number of people might be found attending.

If we had dissuaded any one from going to hear you or tried any how to
estrange them from the diffrt Churches you might indeed find fault with us.
But we can assure you that we have not influenced them at all in these mat-
ters and that Church questions have never been mooted by us.

I am sorry to hear it and shall do what is in me to counteract. Your kind-
ness encourages me to add that if what happened to you had happened to me
I should perhaps have sought the reason more in personal than in Church
feelings. Might not some men be offended by reports which represent you as
sharing more freely in worldly amusements than ministers of Christ are gen-
erally wont to do? I say this in this freedom in order to be quite candid
with you and beg you to pardon one who is conscious of having deserved no
preference of the existence of divisions and heartburnings I was not aware
before your letter informed me of it. However what is past is past: if I
should have been too careless in the matter I know now how I may avoid giv-
ing offence. Should Mr Henderson ever pay a visit like yours, we shall make
it a point - to prove to him our anxiety to let these men profit by any
Gospel ministry that can be obtained, more especially by one in accordance
2with their national tastes1 and predilections.

This is no mockhumility if you consider I have been a stranger to most of
my hearers up to the 25th Nov when I preached to them for the first time.
you will not think me puffed up at* any illusions on this subject
