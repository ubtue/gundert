An Herrn F Gundert in Calw

                                                              <24 Mai 84.>*

Saturday 2 PM. I write this at Bruchsal Fancy I was told at Frankft that I
could not get to Mlbr before 7 PM, so intended to go by slow train. But
then I discovered the Kopps from Afr who came from Hambg and went to Basle,
and in order to accompany them, took express to Heidelbg. When arrived
there I found by the WÅrtbg (old) plan that in going to MÅhlacker and re-
turning I c[oul]d gain some hours. Came to Br.<uchsal>* and found that I
c[oul]d take a ticket to Mlbr expr. where I shall be within an hour. DV.
goodbye
