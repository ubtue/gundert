An Herrn F Gundert in Calw, WÅrtemberg

                                                         Fkft <18 Mai 84.>*

6 PM So far well arrived here. With one of the emigrants, a good woman from
Liebelsbg I could talk somewhat, she being glad to find one whom she knew a
little Gzlr had encouraged her to go to her son in Amer. Daughters and
others went along. I left them at Durl. and had nice company to Fkft. A re-
turn ticket was only to be got here (for 8 days), at Heidelbg they had one
for Hambg but not to Br. Now I wish you a good day, plenty love to Ma and
all around you. The day was magnificent and my hope for a quiet night pret-
ty strong, no fatigue as yet.
