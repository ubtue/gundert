You may imagine how glad I was in hearing that dear Emma as well as her
family are disposed towards you, I think that the Lord is very gracious to
you having now made your heart at ease without any affort or exertion on
your part nor on ours, The Lord has seen that you tried to keep quiet leav-
ing Him your concern, take it a token that if you leave Him every thing He
shall care for you tenderly, fatherly and wonderfully. It is a great thing
to learn to trust the Lord in all things, and remain very quiet, full hope
set on Him alone. May our Lord give you this grace for the future, in great
and small things. We are thankful and joyful for you

Adieu dear Son yours
