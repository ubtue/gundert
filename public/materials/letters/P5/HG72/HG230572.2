Forts.: 23d <May 1872>*
We were glad to get a letter from you, Your box or coffre came yesterday. I
went to see the Lamparders yesterday who were still in Eslingen, from Mrs.
Lotholz I hear that Mrs. W”hrle is not yet well, her leg pains her still. I
would have gone to see her; but the road is very bad. I trust I shall go
to morrow.

We were enchanted to hear that the boys behaved so well and thereby deserv-
ed creuzerle I send a kiss to each specially to dear Carl on his birthday.
We had seen by the papers the devastation in Tubingen and still more els-
where!

All the news here or about us you get in abundance from Jettle and papa. So
with much love to all your dear friends as well as ours I remain yours af-
fectly
