Forts.: 3d February [1872]
Yesterday we were in Nagold, where pretty many peopel had come troz the po-
ken, it was nice, Helfer Elseser spoke nicely on the words "worket as long
as it is day" then Verner from Efringen spoke rather long I did not under-
stand him well; then papa finished with several remarks on the different
fields of the mission, and a very good prayer, specially that God would
send fitted and propre, useful labourers in His work.

Yesterday and today I have thought more on the words of the Lord, "had you
faith as a grain of mustard you would tell to this mountain be remouved in
the sea and it would be so, There are often such mountains before us about
which we say with the women who shall remouve the big stone from before the
grave. A big mountain has God remouved before you, shall He not remouve the
others? perhaps He will require more faith; but only faith, prayer and
faith are to be exercised; an action would be sooner done, and even easier
than to exercise faith; but God will have it. It is a daily exercise and
experience in it makes us bold and confident in our Lord whose words are
all true
