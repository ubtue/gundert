as usual, she excused themselves for having been unabel to arrange the
things in a more favorable way or so little adventagoues for you; but re-
garding the present state of things in our days they could really not do
better, The wool is extreemely dear, the peopel at work have all agreed to
require more pay and have sent him a petition. Altogether the things are
