Since I hear that you really think in earnest to come to Europe I begin to
rejoice and am looking for May with pleasure; may the Lord greant us a joy-
ful meeting and a time of real blessing together, your dear wife how happy
shall we be to kiss her and ask her advice about housekeeping, As for the
dear children I see already how grandpapa will play with them and take a
walk every day showing them all the beauties of Calw. yes I hope the Lord
will bring you in our midst with joy.

Uranie salutes you all heartily I am glad that she shall see you. Frederic
from New York has witten her that he expects you, so you will be able to
give us news from my both brothers with their family. <Ich schrieb gerade

With a tender kiss to each of you.
