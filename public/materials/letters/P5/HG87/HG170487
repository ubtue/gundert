Forts.: 17 Apr 87
You needn't fear my coming for your sake, there is a person nearer to me
than even you whose benefit I have in view. I feel that for the present I
have done enough here and that a change is indicated in this season. The
Childr's leaf is almost all done, except there be yet any extracts from Em-
ma K's letters to be inserted. But I must have a good bath and other com-
forts in the accustomed way. For the remainder of the work here I must
chose another time. Besides invitations are commencing to trouble me and
the throat is not yet free. But why enlarge on the old man's wants. He must
be permitted to be homesick at times and longing after his folk. Genl God-
dard (John G.) sent a money order to the post for 1 ú to aid the dear Mis-
sion "If you apply for it you will get it." Let dear Eddy cash it! Stach
wrote a letter to Herm so tell him if he is a good boy he may get it Tues-
day after 3 PM. With God's blessing we shall come home safely. I have also
the particulars about Akem. Plenty love to all
