We were very glad to hear of your being better tho' it seems you write in
bed. Jet has today gone to K after she had with me witnessed the joy of
Oe's children in seeking their Easter hare a most lively scene. I had today
the satisfaction of being good for something: a Norsk letter, application
of a young schoolmaster with good testimonials for reception in the M.
house, to be sent as Miss[ionar]y to China, had to be translated. Did jet
tell of a Japanese who is since 10 days in the house? Have not yet seen
him, nor did Graf come; perhaps he has vacation like some others. The sick
brother Bader is improving, his mother who knows all about Held, living
near Dinglingen, dines generally with us. Goodfriday evening I greeted
Christine, Mrs Ammann and Cockburn, the latter will visit me. I have not
yet left the Miss. house for any visit, nor seen the good people here. I
hope yourself and Mrs. S. are feeling the fine weather, I work generally
with open windows, but the work itself is wearisome and tries my small
store of patience

                      Good bye to all with love yr F.
