This morning Goodfrid I received your note, glad to hear of some amendment
of health, but grieved for dear Mary. Jet was today with K's, I worked on,
but heard this evening Oe. explaining the last verses of Is. LIII in the
Bibelstunde. Easterevening I am to hold it. When it was over, Christine
came to greet me, Mrs Cockb. Pfleid. Amm. etc good people plenty. I have as
yet only passed one evening with Pfist and the boys, saw them sup and heard
the Inthought. Dear people here, also Miss Reutern. The prospects of Cam.
Miss. bright enough, Christllr's descriptions most amusing. He knows to
sketch the men and things, f. i. the Gov. who uses many expressions for his
subjects of which Schweinebande is perhaps the mildest. None of the stu-
dents was with me. With Oe. there were already Kinzl and Rîm. to join in
drinking Coffee. Now Pfleid is to come also I have not yet left the compd.
Goodbye

                            In much love Your F
