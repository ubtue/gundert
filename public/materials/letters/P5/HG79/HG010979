I arrived here well, at 6 o'clock. Yesterday I had a good number of breth-
ren with me who had been at Jacoble's burial. Here I found Mglg with wife
and Herm. He had never received Anderson's answer, therefore could not ad-
vise us. But And. arrived here this morning in the Missionhouse, lookg as
well as a. 67, and relating about all the fds, also Col Young who does not
come to Bale. When John arrives he will have to put up with me at Schuscha
and I have already received for him a little book of sermons to be critici-
zed, they are by a Russian. This afternoon we are invited into K Sarasin's
garden. I met a "Katharine" who wants to be remembered very heartily to Ma-
ma Hoch. She wd not tell more of her name, but stopped me on the street to
inquire after her health. Good bye to all
