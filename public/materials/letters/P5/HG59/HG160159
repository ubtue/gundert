Lord has opened a door to Capt Taylor in Brennen I shall be glad to hear
all about it. Was Mrs. I able to bear the fatigue of the large party? What
has been settled about the poor Sauvains?

Mr Pfleidere's account has just come I send it to you as written paper with
the other parcels. Make an end with that Bull I beg either sell it or bring
it back.

Mrs. Glasson paid us a visit with Mrs. Macklin. no news. the ship not yet
arrived, Mr. Grant came to see Capt Taylor, and said he had been told that
he would not leave this before Saturday eve. Give love and thanks to dear
