Once more I write you, before dear Papa leaves us to go to Europe. When I
think of the joy you shall have DV. in seeing your dear Papa, I feel happy
for you. You will not be displeased that Mama is not comming too; the Lord
may perhaps grant me the joy an other time, for the present I have much to
do and my health does not require exactly a change now.

You will be glad to see some of the playthings one has here and to eat some
bashoe puts which Miss Will sends you with her love. We feel now very hot
and would be glad to exchange a little of your cold wind with our warm one.
Lydia remembers you still, she is glad of little Sarah Fritz who is here.
How is learning and obedience going on? Is Paul quite well now? I send to
my precious Fred and Paul much love and plenty kisses, to you too of
course. I trust when Papa comes, he shall hear from your Papa Meuret, that
you are brave, obedient children learning well. Papa has now become so ex-
pert in examination, that he cannot let one part without it and it would be
very sad, if he should find you deficient. If Mr and Mrs Meuret can give
him a good report of you all, it will help to make him well and he shall
ask leave for you and give you many days of joy Now my dear boy, I say
Adieu to you and your sweet brothers.

II Bl„ttchen Datum wie oben. Mama an David (Papa schreibt oben hin: Ge-
schrieben nach der Nachricht von Davids Liebe zu Achilles etc). My sweet
Dav: I hear that you are a great admirer of some persons, who have been in
their time famous in the world. I trust that one day the Man who has been
in deed and truth incomparably great and mighty of oninspeakable valour of
whom the great of this world were jealous and envious, will also one day
become your admiration and only imagine, that like that one you may become
just like him. One has but to look at him to study him and one is made like
him. Do you know whom I mean? Have you begun to consider Him, that friend
of children, who once took little ones upon his lap and who is now at the
right hand of God the Father, calling still children and grown up people to
turn to Him, that is to say, sit also one day in the Heavenly Kingdom. Oh
my dear David and you Paul and Fred. that very great One friend of sinners
loves you, wants to make you very great and partakers of his kingdom. Begin
to look at Him! Adieu dear boys. Yours affectly
