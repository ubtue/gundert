I thank you for your last letter, it is always a joy for us to hear from
you; but specially when you dear new papa and Mama can give you a good wit-
ness.

The other day some people who came from Europe said Frederic and Paul Gun-
dert are no more good children they like to play, but not to learn Is it
true? I trust now you get a new zeal and become truly obedient to the dear
new father and Mother God has given you. I have heard that you can learn
very quick and with very little pain, So God who has given you that gift
will also have you diligent so as to become a propre man. I have been told
that you wish to become as well as Frederic <LockomotiffÅhrer>611 I hope you
shall become some thing better than that. David said he would like to be a
shepherd. And I hope all of you shall become real shepherds like our dear
Lord and shall bring many poor wandering souls in the Saviour s boosom A
shepherd or fisher of men like Peter you shall with God's Grace become; for
this very work we have given you to the Lord from your birth. Be diligent
my very precious Paul
