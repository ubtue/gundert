Many thanks for you two dear letters of the 24. 25 which came together this
morning. I have sent Abraham for the money. I rejoice to hear you are again
better; but dear papa I hope you make up your mind to go home in March or
April for it is not right to try any longer to stay here. To have seen
Moegling so fresh and nice has I hope decided you to try the bath too which
may with God's grace bring you good health again. While here you but linger
on and force yourself to work. I feel thank God better. but I see that I
must get more rest now and than. Now dear Papa Adieu I have inclosed this
to Mr. P in case you should have left already.

Many thanks for your little note. This morning I took a ride by myself and
went over the channel to look what was on the other side of it and found it
nice. Mrs M”rike is always cheerful and kind, it seems everyone is so and
only I am so often cross and naughty. I am often quite ashamed of my-self
Oh! I shall be very happy to have you back again, my dear papa! - I often
desire to have more real longing after Jesus, but alas! how often I do not
care much for Him! How much He cares for me! Truly it is almost incompre-
hensible

But I must tell you … Dieu! With love your own child M.
