I think I have not written you the last time; therefore will now send a few
lines. I like 2very1 much to hear from you, and now that dear Papa is perhaps
with you he will write for you. I shall be so glad for your sake that the
dear papa will spend the winter in Bale.

Here we have much Cholera, not in our house but in the town and neighbour-
hood, In the Jail 60 people died in a few days our good Lord has spared us
hither to.

Two of my little girls are very naughty and give me trouble some time, then
I think of my three sweet boys who perhaps also give trouble to their mas-
ters. Formerly I would have given a good beating to such; now I see nothing
will help but prayers for such. I send a kiss to my sweet Paul, to you too
Adieu my lovely son
