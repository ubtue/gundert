Forts.: 16 Jan <59>*
Friday evening I went soon to bed, at a late hour. Taylor judged the wind
good enough to lift anchor, but in the morning we were not far beyond El-
lattoor. I saw Cook's house thro' the telescope. Only in the afternoon the
breeze strengthend and we anchored off Tellich 4 PM. Landed near saltgodown
and walked up past Buggy's house where I heard that indeed Herre's were ex-
pected the very same evening. We walked to Nettoor, had a nice evening,
Burkhardt called our 2 sons lively fellows they appear to be liked at Bas-
le, but he had been only 6 weeks there and knew little of them. Once he saw
them in the Voranstalt all five together emptying a box of grapes sent from
Stuttg. Then he says they were all equally busy. In vain we waited for the

held at the Engl school. T. had good hopes of Br. who however seemed much
inclined to works. Herre had arrived yesterday evening; but persuaded by
Heb he went to the Fort instead of Nettur as had been settled beforehand,
thinking there would be too many people here. Mrs Herre is tall and propor-
tionally stout: very simple and sans gˆne, I like her. So do I Burkhdt.
Mglg told the Comm. the day after he had been received, that he owed 40.000
fcs. <ist nicht richtig! s. Brf v 25/1>* Inspector was quite shocked and
asked him how <he> could you have a quiet moment with such a debt. Oh, said
he laughing, one does not die of that. But I must say too I cannot under-
stand it! This evening we shall go on to Cannanore.
