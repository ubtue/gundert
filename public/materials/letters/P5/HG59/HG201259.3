Forts.: 20th <Decbr>611 [1859]
I wonder what you are doing in the prospect <Aussicht>611 of Christmas I
should like to see you rejoicing and jumping for joy. Have you thought for
a moment <Augenblick>611 why we have a Christmasday, Have you ever looked at
that little babe who then made the joy of the shepherds. Do you ever think
of that dear Saviour for whose sake you receive presents? I think He is of-
ten much grieved to see children, big people, have great joy in that day;
but all that joy is without Him, yea even without thanks to Him who con-
sented to be born as a man, to live and die for us. Oh my sweet Paul when
will you pray to the dear Lord to come in your heart and rule <regieren>611
in it as Lord?

Was it not very wicked of some of you to say we do not want this Mr Meuret
to be our papa rather be any where else only not here. In another place we
will be good children here only we cannot! How the black dog is working
amongst those children so loved and thought of <by>611 the good shepherd,
When will they hear His voice and repent <bereuen>611. Have you heard of the
work of God amongst children in Wales, how they weep for their sins? When
will my boys shed even one tear, one drop of water for their sins? but per-
haps they are not sinners?

You know that we are on a fine hill here it is so nice so cold. Oh I am
very thankful to injoy this rest and good climate

Adieu my beloved Paul

                          take a hearty kiss from

                                       your Mama J. Gundert
