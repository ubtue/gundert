Forts.: 15th July 1859
This time I write you a few lines. I am sitting quietly in my room taking
care of Julie and Sarah Fritz, who are not quite well. Marie sits at
school. You wrote us a long letter; but almost all verses. I do not belong
to a poetical tribe and like your prose better; but never mind.

Now my sweet Frederic I hope you are happy with your beloved papa and that
you tell him every thought of yours, good and bad, be not afraid. papa will
pray for you and with you and our dear Lord Jesus will give you a new heart
it is that which you want to become happy and a good child. With out faith
and trust in the dear Saviour you can not get any thing; You must not be
discurraged if you do not get at once what you ask from the Lord; but con-
tinue to trust to believe and ask till you get your petition

You have many joys and pleasures these days, you are perhaps still in Cor-
celles while papa goes to Vevey Is not the Lord very good to you? Can you
believe that He loves you much? He would like you to be happy and joyful
telling Him all your little sorrows and concerns.

We have here plenty rains night and day it pours by torrents. You have a
fine sun and hot, it is a pity there are no fruits now else tante Uranie
would have given you from her garden such a quantity! How did you like your
visit?

Give my love to your brothers Paul and David I shall D.V. write them next
month. I send them as well as to you a tender kiss.
