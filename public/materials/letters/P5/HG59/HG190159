This morning comes your letter? no - only the money papers. I return them
at once with receipt. Please to send Abraham Kidaon* with them as he is
mentioned on the back. Then pay Convert 110 Rs (cent dix -) for Fritz and
keep the rest till my return.

Theophil Hoch is very poorly, not exactly sick, but no life about him It is
quite sad to see him thus, the parents are very calm in the Lord. - Hebich
says Mrs Hault. grew cool against you because she once wanted to talk with
you and show letters and you would not take it, but wished rather she
should speak to me. As for me H. has been offended with me when he first
saw me at Palghaut, and then I seemed to him to be opposed to his spirit. I
of course do not recollect it, it was when I had Mrs Leslie with me. Heb.
is very nice and Taylor lives with him in our old house. Fritz is not well
at all it looks like intermittent fever. Schlunk is nice, but Mack looks
rather dead, he was sick to death by exposing himself on the pattimar to
the sun in spite of every warning. David's clothes, your thread etc will
soon come also borers etc for Laufer

BÅhrer saw my sister in law at Staefa and thought her rather nice

Now farewell to all
