Many thanks for the grapes which you have packed and sent us till now. I
had no time to write to Mrs Schwarz to thank her, you will be so kind and
give her this note. At the end of next week you will have to send your wash
and the socks you have to be mended with David have you difficulty to have
them wash? As you have no box you may make a paquet of the remaining of
those which shall not go into Davids box and send it by Beiser in 8 days.
As it is only 4 weeks you may perhaps put every things in Ds box. When you
have an opportunity to buy Merredig do it please. papa will soon want some

Adieu dear Son
