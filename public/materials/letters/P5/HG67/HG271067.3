1. Brief von Julie Gundert.
2. AnfÅgung von Hermann Gundert.
I hope to morrow to hear from you. I do not know why I have more heimweh
after the children now than formerly; and I see with joy that there remain
but 8 weeks to see each other D.V. I hope you are happy in the Lord and in
good health. Do you come often in Olgast or in Hîhe St? Grand Mama is of
course very happy to have a baby in the house and is most time down I sup-
pose. Have you joye and peace dear son? Do you find in Gods word food and
strength? The 8th ch of Luke in the parabel of the sower we can see why
Gods word work so little, and it is still often the case even with believ-
ers. how many things hinder that precious word to live in us, if even one
has ears which hear, which is often rare I must still pray for such ears
which car hear.

I am sorry that Emely Muller will soon leave us, 621sie vergo· auch etliche
ThrÑnen darÅber. Nun aber Lebewohl Es kÅ·t Dich
