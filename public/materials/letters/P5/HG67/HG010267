Many thanks for your good letter. I am very glad that you tell me your
feelings about the M. <Mck>* in your house. It is for you a school. if you
have grace to overcome yourself in this matter you will get great blessings
Perhaps I would feel something like you about the M. <(Mck)>* but as we
know that they are children of God we must overcome ourselves and well con-
sider the words of John who says, if we do not love the brethern we are in
darkness. love to the brethren whomsoever they may be and however they may
be, is the chief mark of our having passed from death to life. Some it is
difficult to love it is quite true, I feel it too. but the Lord loves us
however bad and desagreable we are; therefore we must love all the children
of God; lately I have thought more about it as I was reading the Epistel of
John, read it too I pray you specialy the 3d Chap. May God give you rich
blessings. Jea my dear Son pray for love, that you may not have to repent
afterward like your poor mother about Marie,

You may give to papa a cravat like the one you gave me once for Dekinger,
or you may give him a silk pocket heankerchief, foular, these two things
are well come by him but buy 2only one1 between you both David and you.

Now my dear Son once more I thank you to write me all about yourself. may
the Lord give you the victory

                                Adieu yours
