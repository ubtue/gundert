As I hear that you get a good deal of news already I send you but a few
lines, Your last letter has given me much joy, specially the one to your
old friend Mr Mo So the Lord gradually brings you to faith alone! the Lord
be praised for this unspeakable grace. Mrs Zeller in Nagold where we were
lately was much pleased to hear news about the old friend of her nevew Mer-
le. His conversion has of course caused her much joy.

Your account of last year shows what an excellente house mother you have,
beside two children continually visitors and so little expenses; that tes-
tifies in her favour and praise certainly. Dear Christine I wish I could
send a petticoat as she wished to have one for Xmas! Grosspapa and Grossma-
ma would certainly have rejoiced to see their two granddaughters admiring
the beautiful tree which had been prepared for them. We shall be very glad
to get a Ph* of Mariele when one can get it Julius stands very near me,
with Ernst's children. We have also Marie's boy, we are already rich in
grandchildren, without having the joy to see one of them; I hope that dear
Christine with the dear pets and yourself are well.

                           With a kiss your J.G.
