We have just heard from Unkel Adolph that the dear baby so ill is, so that
there is little hope of his life being spared; we are very sorry for it.
And still God must know what he does may our dear brother and sister take
it well from the Lord and therby get the blessings which are intended for
them.

And yourself dear Eddy how are you, chearful still ready to thank the Lord
for His goodness to youward?

I hope you have a good sunday that is that you get food for your soul out
of Gods word, and thereby many blessings. Mr Kittel is with us, he seems to
be a nice young man, He has not gone with papa to the Jungling Verrein be-
cause he has a cold.

Your letter came this morning for which many thanks. I hope the dear baby
may be spared. Rieger had one on the point of death and as soon it got a
Ama s milk it revived. I hope they will try a woman s milk. With love yours
