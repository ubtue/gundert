Many thanks for your note, and for the troubel you took about the soap. I
am glad to have two pounds of the one you bought; I do not want common one;
I would have taken it only if you could not have had your monney back with-
out buying some thing for that value. now it is allright, I want nothing
more, the one you have you shall send me with your wash afterward. David
will have told you that I wait for Paul to go to Schweiz in September. Dur-
ing papa's absence already before Louise goes to see her mother. I shall
then if it is fine weather pass my days in the wood, in schaaf Weg or pie-
tiste weg! You would like to have such a good day no? Our Friend Knorr
looks very happy and free since he has passed the examen, I hope that
thereby his faith has been encreased. I wish you peace and joie
