Many thanks for your two letters, I had not much time till now, Papa came
back for noon unexpected; but we were all delighted to see him and hear so
many nice anecdotes. You shall hear him once too.

I send herewith your trawsers and socks, We shall not wash before I return
from Corcelles; if you should want any thing give them to Grossmama or tan-
te who will kindly have them washed for you; but you 2must pay1 for them

I hope that you are fighting the good fight and get the victory over flesh
and blood I am glad that you had a letter from Paul which did help and ri-
vive you.

                              Adieu dear Son
