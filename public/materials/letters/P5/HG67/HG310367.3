already some days without news from you; but perhaps in your wash KÅsthen
is a note, it comes only tomorrow morning. Today we were in Hirsau, we had

send you another comforter or advocate,

What is doing poor Ludwig has he no place as yet?

Mr Kittle has gone to Nagold for the ordination of Lodholz who is going to
Africa, some other yung men from here have gone too.

Zahn is not well since some time, he suffers from the chest; I know nothing
of the Wirtzes but I think they are well

I hope you are well
