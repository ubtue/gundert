I trust you have a good sunday finding joy in reading Gods word and in
prayer, which are the means to keep us alive.

To day I thought of the words in Revelation 3,15.16 I would thou were cold
or hot, so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
spue thee out of my mouth. How little does one think of these words, they
are told to christian peopel. how many who have been once wart hot have be-
come lukeworm and live very quietly and comfortably, not troubling them-
selves to understand what is ment by the terrible warning. May God preserve
us to be lukewarm; Jea rather fight hard and indure trouble than to become
such, the devil trys his best to keep us asleep and lifeless; therefore
said the Lord watch and pray. in doing this and confessing our Lord we
shall not be Lukewarm; but honour our Saviour. My love to all
