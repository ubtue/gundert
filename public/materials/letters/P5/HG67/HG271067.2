1. Datum und AnfÅgung von Hermann Gundert.
Today we were in Hirsau, as usual God gave us a good word about the resu-
rection of the Lord and faith in Him. it was pretty full. though two bre-
theren alone were there. We shall soon lose our Emely <MÅller>* it seems, I
am sorry for it, we like her much; but the Inspector wishes her in Bale as
teacher in Kinderhouse; You know perhaps more of it than I do. we expect
her mother tomorrow. Have you heard of Paul since he is in Tubingen? I have
still heimweh after him, perhaps more so because he had not been well. I
must learn to believe for him. God will care for body, soul and spirit. but
I feel the need to repeat often the words of our Lords prayer. "lead us not
into temptation; but deliver us from evil" The devil trys by all means to
hurt us, in some way or other, and comes still as an engel of light to
tempt us, therefore the Lord has said watch and pray that ye fall not. How
is Eyman does he hear Hebich? give him my love as well as to all other
friends
