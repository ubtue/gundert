Dear Frederic

Thanks for your letter recieved this morning. it would not have been need-
ful to take the troubel to write to your tante. I had already thanked in
your name.

I am glad to see by your letters that you occupy yourself with the word of
God. it is the means to be preserved from many other unprofitabel thoughts
and to grow in knowlege and grace, may God give you more and more thirst
after the bread of life so that you be fed thereby to praise our Lord.

Give my love to your household. how is tante Anna?

                              Adieu dear son
