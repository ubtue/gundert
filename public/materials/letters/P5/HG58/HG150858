Yesterday at Kaity to bid farewell to Plebst. Tomorrow he will go by trans-
it to Bang. I sent yesterday the money papers, addressing the bills with
Convert's name as you said Fr. would be absent for 10 days more. When you
get 216- pay to Fritz 130- and keep the rest. On new account Fr. will per-
haps be so good as to send me 30 Rs or something like it in an order. This
is for my journey down. - On Friday dined with Mrs Lawson and Mrs Bennett,
her daughter. The first an experienced Scotch woman, whom I like truly; she
told the Free Church Padre at Bomb that he was too flowery and full of mor-
als, at which he got angry and said he preached as free a Gospel as any,
but Mrs. L. not finding there food convenient for her went to Mr Candy and
put up with Engl. Church forms rather than starve in the Presbyterian Cha-
pel. Her daughter is married to a paymaster in the Ind. Navy, both good
people. The latter saw our Marie at breakfast (?New year) at Mr Consens' at
Bombay. I hope the Moharam goes over without annoying you too much. Fare-
well for the present. - The rain - coming from the East - shows that the
heavy western Monsoon is now allaying, and it is time for me to pack soon
and go down.
