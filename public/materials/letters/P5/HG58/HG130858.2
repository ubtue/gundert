Mrs Whiteh. asked kindly after you as did also Miss van Someren at Ooty.
You see you have already friends in parts which you have not yet seen.

You will know that the So. Mahratta Stations had been exposed to great per-
il by the revolt of some chieftains and wicked Brahmins, but all is quiet
again. It seems that Leonberger was in the very centre of the revolt short-
ly before the outbreak and the Rajah who is now hanged was particularly
hospitable to him (as if wishing to disarm all suspicion).

You may be sure that preaching will be done carefully and cautiously, and
only real love, not expressed merely, but also felt and tangible, can make
it tolerable to some ears. The boldness of testifying is a gift and lies
less within the sphere of the young and of women in general, but the love
of Christ teaching and constraining us we may find ways to preach even
without words as Peter has it. It is not that I find fault with your free-
dom to Miss Caemerer, for I think she may consider herself well as your
schoolfellow and herself not so immensely superior. But with older persons
you must be careful, pray first, and try to realise that they may have much
which you never discovered in them, and then begin to speak with respect
and love. To kings one can never preach Christ (says Boos) except by being
brought before them for judgment Love finds a way.
