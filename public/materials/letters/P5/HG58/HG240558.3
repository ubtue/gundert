Shall I also once point out mistakes? on Papa = own Papa. lignes = lines.
Mrs Bean never gave me her 2loves1. This is quite out of order from a lady to
a Gentleman. She gave me regards and that sort of thing. Christians send
each other love (Singular). perheaps = perhaps (from hap GlÅck, daher hap-
py). merchand = merchant. "To yesterday was Pentecost." Hat es sich bis auf
gestern erstreckt? oder hei·t es So? Wahrscheinlich 2to1 small 2as1 = 2too1 small
2than1 that God should think of it. damb = damp daher unser dÑmpfig. Soviel
im letzten die frÅheren mag ich nicht nachsehen, sonst Ñrgert Dich der
Brief troz des excellenten Papiers.

The Addis speak often of their Alice, who died of consumption about one
year ago in a heavenly frame of mind. That is what we will be ready for, to
go out of this poor world at a moment's notice and have nothing to regret,
because blood and Spirit have done their work and taken away all sting of
sin. But these are transactions that are brought about by strange workings
and hard struggles. Well - all in its time. You will also one day be drawn
into it and learn 2a little1 to understand Gethsemane.
