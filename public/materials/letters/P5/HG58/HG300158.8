Also of you, I heard plenty things, and liked so much to see you in the
portrait - You look quite as before, so stern in your look - and with beau-
tiful red cheeks, says Marie David has also some colour, only Freddy re-
mains like his mama, pale, and with his sick look. - Apropos! I have got
such a beautiful little bag, I dont know from whom - I dare say, it is from
one of the little Gunderts - I like it very, very much - I saw also a large
one with Mr Laufer, and he told me, that it had been done by one of the
little Gunderts - Papa never travels without his bag - You know your Mimi
is still at Mangalore, she would have liked very much to come; but, there
is too much work there. I send sincere love and thanks to dear aunt Kul-
mann, and Miss Burk. With a tender kiss to you -

Your dear mama
