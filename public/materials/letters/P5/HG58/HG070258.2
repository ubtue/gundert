Now it is already eight days since you have left us, indead the time seams
much longer to me, happy I am to hope that in eight days more you will have
joined us. Mrs Diez left us last saturday and I take now my lessons by the
Catechist's wife, whom I like much and I give her a little English lessons,
but I fear to be no good teacher. Till now all went good and I like Calicut
more and more, though I find one day like the other like one egg ressembles
to the other, but I like them, they are not verleidet to me; also I am
still in the beginning of being here. And when you have come back it will
be still more agrÇable. Now farewell dear papa! With a warm kiss I am
