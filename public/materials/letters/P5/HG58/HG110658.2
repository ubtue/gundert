Forts.: 11 June <58>*
I have 2 letters of yours before me of the 9th and 10th Mrs Daur's little
verse is indeed very simple and comprehensive. If H.<arriet>* H.<odges>*
shd despise you, I think it can only be from not knowing herself. I believe
that worldly men of some experience in their own affairs do not despise
others without despising themselves first. Nearly the first thing in a
Christian is the feeling how much more he sees of evil in himself than in
others. - I have not yet read your letters to Europe except that to Herm.
and I think it quite right that you show him your mind just as it is. It
cannot hurt him to be told that you like considerate treatment. As for
writing another letter it is something which I now and then felt would be
very desirable, but I am generally too lazy, and trust that if it was hurt-
ful God may have it lost in the transit, or take away the evil so that the
readers be not injured but rather pity me. One cannot always make the 2d
positively better than the first was. Perhaps you see some levity in this.
Then don't imitate me. Thank Mr Fritz for his letter of the 9th which ar-
rived yesterday - today the pomegranates came (Rs 2.4 - paid for them on
post) I believe one was taken out, as there were only 13 instead of 14, one
I ate immediately, because I had this morning finished my last one from
Ward. But now I am medicineless and feel only the bitter for it, so that
this eating is more a Schleckerey than a needful help to the poor body.
However I shall leave a good rest to Str. As for the curry I shall ask Rama
to advise me and hope I shall write accordingly. Letters sent on Monday
morning may reach me at Coonoor on Wednesday, and even a day later may yet
do for the overland post

I shall feel much obliged by your allowing the accompanying boxes to remain
in your house - and which I have directed a Native to pack in a bandy as
soon as my things from Metupalliam arrive, and then he will bring it to
Palghat. -
