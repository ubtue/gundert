I have seen J Groves - very old, Jessie came to Church, otherwise I have
not seen her. Mrs G is gracious when I meet her (drawn in a chair by Bur-
ghers) I confess I have no drawing towards their grand company and you can
not get them alone. JG. was 6 days here and did not call! - Mr Arb. I never
saw since my first visit which he tried to return but found me not at home.
It is best not to be too close with great Masters. Mr Rob. will now be at
Ooty but I have small chance of visiting him there

Frank Groves will be up here one of these days. I wonder if he will come to
see me. Plebst prefers Coonoor by far to Kaity - so do I! Yesterday saw W
Stanes' plantation

No news therefore goodbye
