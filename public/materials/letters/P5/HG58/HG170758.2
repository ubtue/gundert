Yesterday we received yours of the 12th for which thanks. So Kaudingu would
like to have the congregation instead of the Catechists Poor Mangalore from
the begining what poor care have they had!

Mr Convert instead of going to Coilandi is keeping his bed room with a cold
and fever. The Hodgeses send you love by this time you will have seen the
Groves He is ill they say. Have you see much of Arbuthnet is he some what
friendly. Mr Robinson is also there I suppose. Love to all our people
