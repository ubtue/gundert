Forts.: 8 Jan 58
Returned this morning tired from Casergode. Rather glad after all that Ma-
rie begins her Indian life with a disappointment. Many such are sure to
follow and will educate her better under God's blessing than if we did re-
prove her ever so strongly. I shall - as far as I see now - not fish for
her stories but merely try to make her believe in our love and - what is
more - in God's thro' Christ Jesus - (Of coarse - of course is meant a ste-
rick = hysterics.) You see Hauff has written at last to Pfl and Marie en-
closed to <Rev. Hermann Gundert>611, this bit of Selam. It does not appear
untrue to me, except that it shows she does not know her excitement. <Man-
galur>611 is considerably less anxious about the party than it was, they have
made us wait so long that we now care less about them. H. wrote rather
stiffly to Pfl. My impression is that Marie keeps up an artificial excite-
ment within herself and is always more or less intoxicated. I can imagine
her already sighing under the daily routine of going to school with you,
doing tasks for me etc. But the Lord will make her sober one day. What
should we be if He had not done it. Let Fritz read to you the preceding.

Bossh. wrote that Laufer wants a change. I should think so - chiefly in-
wardly.

Robinson writes often about Paulgh. I have copied it all for Josenhans. But
I do not believe that the danger Mr Taylor threatens us with is so very
near.

If possible I shall write to the Kinderhaus, with the Basle letter, so must
close for today. There is plenty work before me. The Caserg Schools pro-
mises better than that of Carcal. - The Stangers I hear have been sent off
beyond Bellary

Now farewell
