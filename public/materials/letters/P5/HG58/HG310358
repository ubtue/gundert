Forts.: 31 March 1858.
I think it my duty to apprise you without delay, though by an other hand,
of a resolution I have formed after reviewing my years connection with the
Government service.

I set out on my task with a considerable amount of strength and courage,
throwing myself, as I thought, heart and soul into the work before me; how-
ever that may have been I feel that a change has taken place. After some
premonitory warnings I have during the last 2 months struggled with com-
plaints new to me, under which I lost my sense of comfort in my peculiar
work, and, now I have been prostrated with a severe attack of dysentry, of
which Dr Leslie has informed you. Under these circumstances I conceive that
I overrated my strength when I entered, after so many years spent in India
upon this new employment. I feel therefore bound to request you to resume
the charge you have honoured me with at your earliest convenience. I hope
in the course of next week to return to Calicut where I may commence prepa-
rations for making over my office to my successor.

I remain my dear Sir

                                yours truly
