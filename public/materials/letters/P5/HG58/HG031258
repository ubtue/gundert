Forts.: 3d Decemb <58>*
Your two last letters have given me joy in the Lord so that the tears of
anxiety have turned to tears of joy and thankfulness to Him who has quick-
ned and revived you again to a lively hope, herein is our life and strength
in having that lively hope which often becomes very dim by unbelief and
sin.

You say to serve the Lord or to be a Christian 2half1 is great shame, Yes it
is and more than that, it is a 2great loss1 to our souls and to the kingdom
of our Lord, while it is a gain to Satan and to his kingdom. Glory to God
for His work in You. I thank you for your love to my poor Frederic who is
very dear to me
