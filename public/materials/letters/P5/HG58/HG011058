Though I wrote to you last month and not to your brothers still I will add
a few lines to you too.

I am now quite alone and I want very much to hear from my sweet sons espe-
cially from you my dearest Frederic; for I am very often in my mind with
you and fancy to see you some time hunging down your head and wearied; but
be of good chear a better time for you will come the Lord will give you a
better health then it will be more easy for you to learn. Only try to be-
lieve in the love of those set over you and above all in the unwearied love
of the dear Saviour who watches over you and waits when you will turn to
Him. Do you also pray to the dear Saviour? My precious son to Him I reco-
mend you who can and will do far above what we ask Adieu my sweet Frederic
