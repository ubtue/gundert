The Whitehouse will now soon come up when I hear of your friend, the ad-
dresser of the pig, I shall try to send you a notice about his welfare. -
It is right that you feel a little excited by Gompertz's letter, for he is
one in a 1000, and many a Church or little Congregation has none like him.
but this must be said in private, as no man can swallow and digest praise
readily. I am sure the Lord is pleased with him just because he himself is
hardly aware of the remarkable character discernible in him. - You read the
Mercury and the notice of uncle? Now farewell

I have been unexpectedly detained on Plantation - and fear I shall not be
able to go with you to Jackatalla

Shall I lend you a pony to carry you to Kaity? or as far as the top of the
big hill? -

If you would like one I will send it to the Coonoor bridge at once - I am
sorry I cannot go to Jackatalla today - and am much obliged for your kind
suggestions about Waterwheel etc

With our kind regards

                            Yours very Sincerely
