I do not think Mr Heb. will pass through Calicut nor even thro Ooty where
he is more wanted: but his way will go by Bang. straight to the Eastern
Coast.

It is a great grace if we can draw near with a true heart (as Hebr X,22).
The heart easily becomes untrue again, as we are born hypocrites and forma-
lists, ready for any dead work and lipservice rather than for a real
priestly approach to our father's throne

<Revd>611 Miss <Gundert>611 is invited to be a priest indeed, that means one
who likes coming near God and bringing to Him Sacrifices of praise and
thanks, together with the sighs and wishes of her poor heart. But if she
prefers distance and compliments, He can be distant too and keep her at
arm's length. You will now make all sorts of experiences how the heart
shifts and turns every way before it becomes quite subdued and weaned, and
seeks above all Rest in the father's bosom. Christ however continues inter-
ceding for us in our way ward moments. What would else become of us, when
Satan tries to sift us as wheat.

Farewell now for two days. Tell me if the apple was good. I have not yet
tasted any up here.
