Plebst and Moer came in yesterday from Kotergiri, the former intends soon
to go down to Bang. Hoch may accompany him, but they will certainly be a
month longer on the hills than I. Miss Hale is certainly a nice Christian,
whom all esteem. Mrs van Someren lives with her and they seem to be earnest
together and devoted to the young of the joint family. Who is the Peper611
who had to sit outside Calicut Church?

Mrs Mgl's letter you might return once with other papers, I mean that about
Mgl's separation from Basle. It may interest here the Kaity brethren. All
are sorry for this step. Of course nothing else could be expected if Mgl
did not even take the trouble of going to Basle to hear what they may have
against him. Herm. describes him very well. I dare say he will have pro-
ceeded to thouing before many minutes.

Yesterday so many came to the meeting that our chairs would not suffice and
Boswell's had to sit on my Sopha in the next room, Moer and Plebst having
only a bed to sit on.

There are rumors that the Governor <Harris>* seems incurable. Dr Sanderson
has been cited up for him. Major Minchin has written that Casamajor's West-
indian (Antigua) mortgage is apparently irrecoverable. Now farewell and may
the Lord give you all joy and peace
