No wonder if you are sometimes funny, the world is funny and you cannot
help being in it and part and parcel of it. How funny it will one time be
to talk of the things that 2were1. I mean when we are surrounded by the
things that 2are1, and will never change any more. Then it will be funny in-
deed to look back upon our funny tricks and ways in this "curious world, Mr
Layer."

Today a lady sat opposite me that looked at me as I thought as a very funny
fellow, being so enthusiastic about a future world beyond death and judg-
ment, and making noise about it in my German accent. But somehow or other a
good and gracious Lord can make us seriously to think on what at first
looked only funny. It is a great thing to learn quietly to deliver our fun-
ny impressions about a great reality, and trust Him that He can use it all
and put it to rights in the hearer's minds, though they feel disposed to
make fun of it.

Augustine and Luther when talking of God find it very strange that he deals
with us, with me, as if there was no other man on earth - both use nearly
the same words about it, tho' they lived 1100 years asunder. You will also
find that He is such a one, and occupies Himself with you as if He had no
other matters to attend you. This I call a Royal way indeed. The least we
should do, would be to attend also to Him alone as if there was no other
God, no other reality beside Him. But we shall not so soon succeed in imi-
tating Him. What do you think.
