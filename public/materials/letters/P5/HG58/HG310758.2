Forts.: 31 July <58>*
only a word with this I will write tomorrow. The news first that Gomp has
brought Capt Taylor of the I. Navy to Jesus, and 2he1 T. preaches now to
Fisher, Williams etc. 2 Soldiers converted in Gomp's meetings it seems! You
know T. kept the sister of Goddard's concubine. - Mgl is now separated from
Basle - by correspdce begun at Triest. I am sorry for it, he did not even
go there, had Karl brought to him. Our boys and brother have seen him at
Stuttg and TÅbingen. But I will send you Pauline's extracts. - Tom St's
hand is slowly coming round. - Nothing yet from our boys? Now it's Sunday 211
2Aug1 I hope we shall have a good day farewell
