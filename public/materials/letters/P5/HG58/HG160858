Many thanks for yours of 13th To day we may get home letters! Marie says
that Lydia asks whether one will take her to Mang she heard me saying that
if you have to go there and you would take me along I would like to go if
it is God's will for a little change or trip which might perhaps take place
with the Hochs when they go back. Mrs Leslie has sent many thanks for the
Arrowroot, they were very glad of it, her letter you shall get with other
written paper when occasion occur.

Does your health continue to improve? Are you perfectly free from the sick-
ness you suffered from. Here many people are troubled with fever and rhuma-
tism.

With love to dear Sister Hoch and to the other friends
