Forts.: 20 Dec <58>*
3 AM I arrived at Badagherry everything comfortable in the fine moonlight,
only the boat was very narrow the better boats havg been taken by the
schoolboys escaping from the Provl School to their homes. Examined Gres-
seux's school, which was in good state - really nice. Evening Chombala hap-
py evening. Bess sends her love, so do the people. Tuesday morning rode to
Tellichy, Mrs Buggy's house Sauv's still there breakfast there and examina-
tion. Now 2 PM at Nettoor where Hunziker and WÅrtele still are. Mrs S
spends the day here for the air. S. continues to be idle and content with
himself, poor fellow - Sarah nice - The gardener Sri Candan just dead!
(without faith)

With much love
