Yesterday evening your and Mary's letters rejoiced me much. But I cannot
answer them. In fact the Dr grumbled yesterday when he heard I had written
as he demands absolute rest. He offered to write to you but I said that
would frighten you. Any how I may give you the news that he says the worst
symptoms are over. But he still weakens me by emptying me thoroughly. It
was good I came under such effective treatment. He is always about me and
enquiring, confesses now that the first day he was somewhat anxious about
me So give thanks so far and be without fear.

I chiefly wanted 2no1 business letters, nothing to bother me. What you have
of nice things send. Write to Basle etc 2without1 me.
