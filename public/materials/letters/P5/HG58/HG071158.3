gehts jedem gut. Gelt Come to Jesus!

We were glad to hear by your brothers that you three little ones are doing
pretty well. I long to hear that you have a papa and mama caring for you,
Marie has told me how the dear lady who is to be you mama has been kind to
her at Kornthal once when she was distressed how she comforted her and
helped her; this little insight of that dear lady has rejoiced me much spe-
cially for you precious child who want a kind loving mother who can bear
with your poor weak nerves, love you even when you are some what out of
tune and wearied with trifles, learning, and restlessness.

Dear Child we think often of you and commit you to the dear Lord Jesus who
can do much better than we could, we know that He heares prayers and will
do all right for you. I send a kiss to you three dear precious sons.

Kind regards to the dear lady the Lord has given you for mother, I trust
you will be obedient and love those dear people God has given you instead
of us. You will soon be nearer your brothers which will be a comfort too

Since I wrote you the first part I have received from yourselves a letter
for which plenty thanks, so you had pain in a foot, sweet sonly <Sohnele>621.
We are much with you in our minds. Give also my thanks to dear Miss Con-
stantia for her kind note about you: it is very kind of her to have written
I have no time just now to write to her but send her kind love.

Give also my love to dear Hermann and Samuel to whom I do not write this
time. I rejoice to know the Lord is with them and keep them

Kisses to you specially and to my precious Paul and David
