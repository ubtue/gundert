You wonder how the Lord can use people who have still so much of self. But
I suppose he has done so from the beginning. Of course it is a wonder. How-
ever He sees fit to work not merely thro' weak but also through defiled in-
struments however much He would delight to have a sufficiency of purified
souls and hands in his service. That was the grief of the prophets of old.
They felt how unclean they were, and how little their high position accord-
ed with what they felt of the utter corruption of their hearts: and yet
they were used to good purpose, and with us also where shall we find one
that does not bear about him the marks of his old offspring though he is so
much honored as to bring souls to Christ. I dare say Gomp felt like Peter
of old: Go out from me Lord for I am a sinful man

C. He will now soon go to Bangalore, in order to cast Canarese types at
Sanderson's. We have thought it would be a good thing if we had also Ma-
layalam types in Tellicherry or Mangalore.

The Governor is likely to come to <Coonoor>621 for his health's sake. Drs do
not like to speak about his illness, as they seem to disagree about it, But
it is now said he is better than he was.

Mgl has certainly disappointed us all. For who did not expect he would go
to Basle and there hear what they had to say against him, before he broke
off. From letters I never expected any good in his case. Only free conver-
sation could have removed the obstacles in the way. May God still guide
him, so as not to destroy. H Kaund. seems to long after being set free from
the work in the Congregation for the purpose of devoting himself to itiner-
ating work. But I fear he only wishes not to be bound down to regular du-
ties. Or what else can it be? We hear little from the Mang brethren, and
that little is not very satisfactory. But at Hoobly there is something new.
A smith came out in a neighbouring village and he feels strong to remain in
the place and witness to Christ amongst his own people. MÅller however does
not write about it, we know it only from Dharw. brethren. Strobel is I be-
lieve very diligent in his new station. I am glad to see him again on my
way. If only the English work does not prevent his progress in Mal! Now
farewell Grace be with you and
