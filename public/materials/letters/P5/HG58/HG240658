Forts.: 24 June <58>*
Yesterday came Dobbie and returned in the evening. He relates a good deal
of the 39th, loves Kerr particularly but Mrs Hodson annoyed him much. His
wife seems to be pressing on, he is fond of his baby. Harkness didn't come
with him, as they found no 2d pony - Strobel pleased with Ward and Cornish,
less with Addis into whose house he now goes. Rehling prays with Obrien,
but new lies come to the light which he told his superior. - Your objec-
tions to the liturgy are very natural but are you sure that extemp prayer
would quicken the people and cause a revival? Life engenders life no doubt,
so for life we are to pray and to seek but not for any particular forms. -
I have leave to the 31 Aug. - What is Gabriel? "the man (or hero) of God" -
Mrs Hoch's sister Lydia died in the faith after having had a clouded mind
for several months Tom Stanes very childlike and nice, also his brother I
like, but not Mme. Moer quite well and cheered with his prospects here. -
At Mang Miss Will does of course all the work. Mrs Hauff keeps rather aloof
the language appears hard to them

Pfleid is to marry a Miss Werner (Plebsts cousine) I am sorry for Haller's
marriage but he would have it so, Pauline never saw a lover more decided
than H. - We shall probably have here a Wednesday meeting. Mrs Francis ask-
ed for it, as she would hear <Dr. Gundert>611, but must on Sundays go to the
Church at <Coonoor>611. I hear good reports of her. Also Dobb. is fond of her
husbd and thinks him truly nice, Ward is louder yet in his praise. Now
farewell
