Your letter with those of your brothers gave us much joy a few days ago.
Papa and Marie are caring that every one of you may get stamps. where ever
Marie sees one she takes it I was specially pleased to hear that you become
diligent in your lessons, and are obedient. If you pray every day to our
dear Lord Jesus He will help you and you will find it easy to do all what
you may have to do and learn! Last time I wrote to my sweet Frederic now I
can only send him here a tender kiss with plenty love! Dear Marie and papa
are I trust writing to you and to him. We have here a monkey which got lose
today and amuses the girls very much he runs after them and they cannot
catch him. Mr Fritz said he would kill him; but all the girls beg for the
life of the monkey!

My very dear Paul Adieu. Kiss and love from your Mama
