In three weeks from this I hope to be at Palghaut, in 4 at Calicut. I also
feel like you that life passes quickly. When a boy at school - I remember
that passing from Kirchengasse through the covered way - where prints are
sold and hanged out for show - to the Gymnasium, I often wondered when at
last the time would come that I might be free from this eternal going up
and down. A year was something very long then I do not find it so now.

Nor do I think the happiness of childhood and youth so great as po‰ts etc
describe it, I rather think I am much more happy now than at any former pe-
riod. You will I hope feel the same and may grace enable you to pass
through all these changes with a grateful heart. Mrs Moerike has an erysi-
pelas (Gesichtsrose) which keeps her at home.

                                 Farewell
