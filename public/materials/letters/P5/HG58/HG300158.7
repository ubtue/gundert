621And you, precious Frederic I heard how you cried and wept because you
could not spend the last hour with dear Marie before she left Basle, and
after all, how quietly you submitted, and went to school after a tender
kiss to Marie and to your aunt - that was very nice and proper. You may
imagine how many questions I make to Marie about you all. And I am so joy-
ful to hear how happy you are, and how many tender cares are bestowed upon
you. Is not the Lord very good to you dear child, He speaks, I know, in
your little heart, and you are sometimes happy to see that He hears your
prayers. - Yes, sweet child, the Lord loves you and hears you, believe it,
and continue to pray - we* also* do it for you. Now accept a tender kiss
from your beloved mama.
