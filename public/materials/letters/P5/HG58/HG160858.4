This morning came the Stuttg letters. You will read them to Mama. I have
already begun to answer them, that is with short notes, so that nothing is
forgotten. And here I could not help to give a pretty strong answer to
Herm. who is not simple enough, I fear from the common sickness that self-
denial is not heartily practised. I wonder how you will translate Lebens-
schwingungen und Nebenanschauungen to M. It is mere Larifari, covering a
certain coolness that has taken possession of him, and he is therefore tru-
ly as he subscribes himself angegriffen (I mean by the enemy). So I hope
you will also heartily pray for him that he run for his life, to be saved
one eyed one handed and one footed rather, than try to connect the wisdom
of the world with the simplicity of the Gospel. - The Whitehouses have yes-
terday left for Ooty (on our ponies) On Sunday he came to Scudder, for he
feared coming to close with us. Then he heard from a Circular that the
Chaplain could not preach from indisposition. He would go to the meeting he
then said, if only it was not of Plymouth brethren: for he feared I was a
Plymouth brother. Sc. laughed and assured him I was not, in consequence
they both came - probably for the first time - to a meeting of dissenters.
Mrs Wh. rather puzzled had at first taken my chair before the table - when
we rose after the blessing, she wondered and asked: is it already over? I
believe mere nervousness But she is a good woman and I am glad we could
help them a little - In a fortnight I hope to descend
