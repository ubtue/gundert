You are very slow with the letters via Madras for Europe. I wish that in
future you rather send them 1-2 days earlier that I know beforehand what I
have to pack. Tomorrow early I shall have to run to the post, ask if there
is anything from Cal. take it and pack it with the others, all before 8 in
the morning. The next letters ought to be here on the 218th1, therefore be
sent on the 16th. - Halfness is of course our chief sickness. One thing
needful, ought to make our souls and desires all sending to one. But whole-
heartedness is the rarest thing about us, and a wonder whenever God can ob-
tain it from us. Therefore strive and find out what divides the heart and
hate it.
