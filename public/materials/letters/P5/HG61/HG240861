A few lines only to thank for your last. and tell you that we are still in
Spirit with you and fight for you by prayers wishing much hunger and thirst
for the word of life with out which you are dead. May you be so dependent
on the help of God that you be forced to cry always for help, wisdome grace
and all what you want.

Adieu dear Son, I am in a hurry

                                 your Mama
