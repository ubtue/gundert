I can scarsly write having been in the garden my hand trembels much. We
were glad to get good news from you, but you do not say how it is about
your complaint.

I have Omeopathy mittle for you we shall try it when you come here

I trust you have grace to love the souls and lead them to Jesus

                              Adieu dear son
