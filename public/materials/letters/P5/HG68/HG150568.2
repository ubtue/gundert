The news of Unkel about Mr Hebich have made us very sad. May God still
leave Him some years!

Your wash has not yet come, please send it quickly.

I am glad that you shall soon see papa if it had been at an other time I
would have liked to see both of you and would have passed a day with you
both; but I cannot yet. afterward I trust
