I have the Key of the old box I found it in a drowr.

How did you come home and how is Tante Emma? to day thursday Mrs Wirz has
sent to invite you to go to her, I shall soon go to hear what she wanted.

Do not forget please to buy the homeopathy medecine for Paul, send them to
me with your wash next Saturday, and tell me how much cost the three small
bottles of Omeopathy.

I come from the garden, and my hand is trembling so I will not write more.
We were glad to get a letter from you

                                Love to all
