It seams me a long time since we heard of you, did you speak with tante Em-
ma on the subject I told you, has she kept for herself that which I unwise-
ly told her about you? tell me a word about it. Jettle is in Liebensel, I
shall perhaps go to Hirsaw where the Colporteur Fisher will have the Stun-
de, This week we shall have much to do, putting tapete in our schlaf and
wohntzimmer besides a wash and cleaning papa s room, You have not writen
since tante has a son, how are mama and child? can she nurse her son?

I hope that you have good time with David, praying together. I read again
Hebich s last words, the more I read them the more I like them and learn
from them. May I walk as he did so true, so faithful regarding God alone.

                              Adieu dear son
