We were very glad to hear again from you, of you I had heard that God gives
you grace to seek souls, that you are kind towards the younger ones, walk-
ing with them trying to bring them to the Lord, this testimony has rejoiec-
ed me greatly and I praise the Lord for His goodness and faithfulness to
you, May He indeed use you to bring many to Himself. I was much rejoieced
to hear through Mr Pretorieus that his son in Uhrach has been of late con-
verted, How do you find Haering? his mother is very thankful for your love
to him, she is a very fine woman, How is F. Muller?

Adieu dear Son
