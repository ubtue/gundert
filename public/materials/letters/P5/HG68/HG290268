Did Mrs. Desselberger remain with you in Cannstatt and how long? how did
you come to Tubingen?

Please send me your wash on next friday 6 March so that I have it saturday
here.

So in three weeks you shall be here D.V. We are as glad of it as yourself
to morrow morning papa is to preach in Stamheim afternoon in Hirsau. I came
from Stutgart with toothache and I have it still a little.

Adieu dear Son
