You will be disapointed to hear that you are not allowed to present your-
self at the examination or Musterung, as papa will tell you. However there
will still come a time that we may see and injoye each other, we must only
have patience and be thankful for the many good things which God gives us.
If we value and apreciate the great gift made us in the son of God we shall
always be grateful and think little of every thing else

How are you dear son? May our Lord give you many blessings by his word and
spirit

                                Love to all
