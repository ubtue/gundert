I pray what have you done such an expensive thing to have sent me. Oh dear
I thank you heartily; but truly I am sorry for your expense, for we have in
the house such needful meubel. Louise has used it during long time, it be-
longs to Jettle it is true; but we use it as our own.

Do not send orleans I shall give of the one I have

Mr Wirz has sent your cloth. I do not buy more till I see what remains aft-
er your things are made

                              Adieu dear Son

Louise Maurus who is just here sends you love

one says that Fetzer does not go any more
