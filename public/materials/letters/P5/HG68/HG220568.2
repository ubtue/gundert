I suppose you need no more the warm blanket now? be so kind and send it me
through David by Beisser, that I may have it washed, you shall get it again
when cleansed.

I wish to all of you a good day at Kornthal If I could have seen much of
you and David I would have come too; but I would scarsly see any thing of
you, and besides we are to iron our wash on monday

                              Adieu dear son.

Your papa puts already on the cap you gave him.

The tailors account I have paid. you need not care for it
