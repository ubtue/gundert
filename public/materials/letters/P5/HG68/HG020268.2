Forts.: <Jan 68>*
Since a few days I am looking for a letter from you mornings and evenings;
but in vain. When I troubel myself about you as if perhaps you were ill,
papa says he does not think so; but you have perhaps much to do. I pray
dear son leave us not so long without news, or tell us that you will in fu-
ture write only once a week than I shall not expect a note from you: though
it would pain me since you are not well, and feel some what anxious.

Next tuesday we are going to Nagold to a Mission Conference. Have you still
good courage? The Lord will hear the prayers which He himself makes us to
pray by His spirit within us. we must learn to wait quietly upon the Lord.
In the old testament we read the words. In being quiet and at rest you
shall be delivered, these words had the people of Israel to believe when
the enemies surounded them and ready to fall on them.

Monday comes your paquet at half past ten 0 clock. Many thanks for your
letter. You should change your sheets every four weeks also your pillow
cases, the night shirts every two weeks I send you here with unschlitt <ich
behalts hier>621 if it helps you, you may continue and after some time try to
be with out it one or two days or till you want it again.

The Lord be praised that you are well! Our Lord who has given you already a
troubled soul in Tubingen will give you more wait upon him

Adieu dear son
