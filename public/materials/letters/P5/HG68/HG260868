I quite forgot to tell you to buy one or two dozen of doubel bottons for
shirts in India the washer man tear the bottons so much that one has none
in the shirts, only buttons hole, We bought formerly by Mr Winkler 2 dozen
for Samuel which Marie brought him, likely your shirts from Bale have no
buttons so you must buy doubel ones white, they are pretty cheap in Stut-
gart, while here and in India specially they are very dear.

The tin box I have sent today with zwiebach you bring back please, also the
velours for Pauls dressing gown with lining and the rechenung sighnd and
see please how much remain still of papa s money there,

Adieu dear Son
