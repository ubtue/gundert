Frederic has just finished his little note, he will have told you how heim-
lich we have been sitting together the whole day while papa with Jettle
were in Stamheim where papa preached twice to day. I am glad I could have a
talk with F who is I think nice, wishing really to grow and glorify His
Lord. It is a pity that Paul is not here, that he went to Kroupenbach to
preach you will have heard, he comes perhaps not back before Frederic re-
turns to Stutgart

This week we have wash and cleaning, and the weather is like at Christmas
at least a foot of snow on the fields, since three days it seases not to
snow and it is pretty cold. You had perhaps your second son baptised to
day, we long to have your description of him, the one of his papa we heard
and like it, we would like to see the joy of Theodor and how he patronises
Herman.

Take care what you are eating as long as you nurse, it depends much on the
milk for a baby to be quiet and brave, I hope and wish that you may nurse
long though it should be but once or twice a day.

I hope that dear Margarets health is better so that she can be at school
the whole day.

There is a good deal of sickness among the peopel, since new year one has
burried as many peopel as one does it usually in one year friday three to
day again three have been burried, most strong and young peopel inflama-
tions dysenterie and sudden death 611Mama mu· der FrÅhlingsputzerei nachgehen
