Your last letter has again made us somewhat uneasy about your throat. in
Stutgart I heard from tante Reiniger whose husband suffered once much in
that way that one should <m”glichst oft mit einer Mischung von einer obern
Tasse voll Eibischthee, einem L”ffel voll Essig und einem L”ffel voll Honig
gurgeln.>611 tante spoke also of Cataplasm made with bread and milk, as long
as as there is swolling one should apply Cataplasm. I hope that before this
reaches you, you will have got better and no more want these remedies, Our
Lord is the good physician who with or without means cures us when we have
understood what He has to teach us through the different trials we have to
go through We must only learn to be with God as children are towards a good
father full of confidence. It is something very precious when we can fully
trust our Lord and in all things put our cares upon Him. Surely He cares
for us.

We praise the Lord to see his work in you, you have now the son and there-
fore Eternal life; in Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and sci-
ence Oh may He be very precious to us, may we daily look for His appearing.

In Stutgart we spoke much of you, all, but especially tante send you hearty
love, she is not quite well. Paul came too there so we had a nice time to-
gether, Frederic is rather disapointed that the conscription does not take
place in March as usual, he expected to be with us a few days; but one
speaks of Automn instead of now. With hearty kisses to you four
