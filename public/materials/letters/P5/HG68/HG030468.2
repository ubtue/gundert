You will have been surprised to get no letter from us through David; but
you know already how the time is usually filled up.

Now you can soon see your papa with Paul and I trust that you come along,
and will be so kind as to bring me the black silk, the Orlean, the grey
futter, and the merredig, and still one thing that is one dozen of balls of
Cotton 2 black <pto>611 We will write about it to Gross Mama so that Paul may
bring with the reddig, but the sewing silk I pray you to care for and the
things of your laden.

Look well at your things before you come to see what you should buy here
for your summer.

Adieu dear Son

                                 Yours JG.

You shall also bring yours and Davids wash or send it per Beiser
