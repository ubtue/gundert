A few lines only. Your last has again given us joy in seing how the Lord is
becoming your Lord and ruler; your best portion, yea in Him we have all,
and are perfectly happy, We can rest upon Him in perfect assurance for body
soul and spirit, also for the health of our dear Christina, He is our phy-
sician, as soon as we have learnt what the Lord has to tell us through the
illness, or trial of any sort. He is ready to help us; but the first thing
is to see and understand what is his mind toward us. We thank the Lord who
gives you joy in your dear little ones.

Paul and David came to day, the first should have come yesterday; but he
lost his way after Herrenberg, went the one of B”bling so he had to pass
the night to Gechingen being to tired to come here, He does not look very
well, but is happy it seems, David has a new elan <franz”s = Aufschwung>*,
finds much food in Gods word and grows in grace and in knowlege.

With a tender kiss to each of you I remain
