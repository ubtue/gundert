Forts.: 2d Sept 1868
Your last has made me some what anxious, as you had again fever; I fear you
are too good with your Ayah, and trust her too much, You allow her so many
times to see her relations spend so many days away it may be too much, she
imagines herself perhaps indispensabel to you! I may be wrong I do not know
I am glad to hear that M. is doing better. Last sunday we had the yung-
lingsverein feast, there were many peopel, it was nice. Frederic came sat-
urday with Adolph and Anna she is nice, much more comunicative than former-
ly. I was very glad that she came. I value her much. Vicar Werner came too
he slept with Frederich in your room while David Charl Weigle and Paul
filled the Vorsale <saal>621 where all the crust <Grust>621 had been put, I had
much joy to see them evidently all growing in the Lord, the very look of
Charl shows that he is an other man. Mrs Pfarer Gross has also been here
she sends you hearty love, they like to be in Giengen, all of them are
healthyer than in Zafelst. Mr and Mrs Deckinger were here too she is much
troubled about him, for he is worse since he was in Liebensel to bath, he
is very quiet and nice saying of his wife she cannot believe must pray for
her, I read with a true delight the Ch Denkmal, I would not have known dear
papa Gundert without reading his letters to wife and sons how full of life,
He knew his Lord well, they really do me good, what a child like spirit.
Dear Frederic sits by me learning Canarise, he is nice, I believe God can
use him in his vinyard, I long to hear how you are, we had a beautiful sum-
mer just as I like good worm
