Your wash has come in time all right; but you forgot to change your night
shirts, they are too dirty. You must change every 2 weeks or even more of-
ten and your socks twice a week. Now you soon come and we may speak of
those things together. Did you not say that on the 25 March you come? Today
I went to church; but understood little of the preaching Our Decan is not
simpel enough for me. I have nothing of his preaching. but in Hirsau God
gave us a good word on Matthew 13.th chap 24-30 As soon as we sleep spirit-
ually, the enemy comes and sows tares, therefore watch and pray.

How is your health now?

Adieu dear Paul
