Forts.: 29 Jun 68
At Carlsruhe I met Mglg, Strobel MÅller etc all determined with Irion to
drag me to the latter's house. So we staid there till 11 and went then on
to Bale, where we lodge with Josenh. Only I leave the room at night to
sleep with MÅller and Bunz on acct of Mglg's usual determination to blow
the trumpet unwittingly

Sunday I held the Martinstunde. Legrand then related at Christ's about the
Worms affair. Mrs Anderson and Diez I have not seen as yet. There was the
special Conference this morning which showed that Krapf thinks the Chri-
schona Mission ought to be given up and its pupils in future only to be
prepared for the Inner Mission (America etc), but it is not sure if the
people here (Jaeger etc) will agree with this view. Money seems to be
scarce indeed and sickness common in India. Plebst will once more have to
try Mang. if he does not get better before next hot season or the rains
then return to Europe. So at least does Inspector seem to think.

I keep this till to morrow evening and send you with this Uranie's letter
which Nagel brought with the valuable contents. I wrote today to Miss Wal-
lis and shall now wait to see what she will answer. Farewell for the pres-
ent and love to all.

a nice letter from Stuttg.

                                 Good bye
                              Diez sends love
