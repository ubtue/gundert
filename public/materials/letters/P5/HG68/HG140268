Many thanks for your good letter; so you had again a difficult time and
were discouraged your sister has been often so and used to say my praying
helps nothing I am always the same. however God has helped and He will also
help you; as soon as we can confess our sins and faults with grief, repent-
ance, the Lord is ready to help; but we must be earnest before our Lord and
if true repentance is not in us we must pray for it; loose not courage be
fervant in prayer! we know and understand little what is that be fervent in
prayer. May God bless you.

The present Unkel Gustave makes us is really valuabel and I thank him
heartily it is too much.

Adieu dear Frederic
