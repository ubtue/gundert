I trust your box has reached you safely.

I hope likewise that the journey on foot has not hurt your health.

You would be glad I suppose if you could every month have a work as you had
in Gruppenbach for 8 days? But the time will soon come where you shall have
daily opportunity to preach and witness.

Next time tell us something of your health

                             Goodbye dear Son
