I trust that the caffee comes still in time and will last till you come to
Calw, you will be so kind to bring me the tin box for caffee next time you
come. The blue night shirts should also be changed every 15 days, the tow-
els for your Caffee pot you may change every three weeks.

Papa wrote a letter on monday, the boys have it. from Marie good news, none
from Samuel this time. This night papa will leave Bale and come tomorrow

try Omeopathy

Now Adieu dear Son
