Please in writing to Bƒle to ask what you are to bring Papa says that you
get every thing there that is, the things you may want besides those you
have already, Shirts and stockings they have always ready for those who are
sent, but it is good to ask. After the wash I shall arenge your things. and
when I come to Stutg take with me shirts of Paul so that all yours remain
clean to go.

                              Adieu dear Son
