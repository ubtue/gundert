Forts.: 6 Sept 1855
Last month we had not the pleasure of hearing from you direct which is a
disappointment, however we had the pleasure to hear by a dear friend that
you are quite well, that my sweet Etty is attentive to the instruction that
the dear Inspector Josenhans is kind enough to give to the children on Sun-
day and that my precious Vow during that instruction moves his legs as if
he did not care much for what he said, I am grieved at that, and I hope my
dear Paul will ask the Lord for good ears and attention to his holy word, I
trust also that both of you are obedient to your aunts to teachers and to
all those who have anything to command you.

You remember when you were at Chiracal we used to go for a walk in the eve-
ning ...n together with the girls did help papa to mend the road, David is
very zealous to help his papa in the same way you did from a good distance
he brings stones almost beyond his strength, he also remembers carefully
the poor little boy at the end of the village to whom you used to bring a
piece of bread, sometime ago he <(David)>* spent one night and day with Mrs
Young next morning when he met me again he pressed me very hard saying, my
dear Mama, my love shall never, never go from you; sometimes he says, I
will not go to Europe I cannot leave you, the other night he had toothache
cried bitterly and was very restless twice I offered him to pray with him
telling him how the dear Lord had made Paul better who had also toothache
after we had prayed, for a long while he refused it angrily, but bye and
bye, when he felt quite wearied and reduced, he said humbly well now Mama
you can pray to Jesus to make me well. He speaks still often of you both:
whenever David drinks milk, he asks if it is the Arabichi Acca's milk if
not does not like to drink it, he is now fast asleep else ... would send
you a kiss I think. Miss Elisa[beth] who writes this for me because I can-
not do it at night sends you a kiss as well as her sister Annah. if Miss
Will was here she would I am sure send plenty love to you both especially
to her pet and favourite Paul but she is at Calicut for a visit. Do you re-
member how we went about in the morning early to pull weeds in our com-
pound, now that the rain is over the children go still to clean all about,
bit I dont go with them so much as I did, I dont feel strong enough to
stand or pull as when you were here.

David now and then runs after the children with his little Caykottu <Hak-
ke>611 or mattock and fancies to be doing a great deal of work. There is at
present at School 66 girls 12 women and some little boys with their Mama's,
they are all very anxious to hear about you and many of them say tell my
name to Etty and Vow with plenty salaams. To day Mr Hebich has been here
after 4 months absence I was very glad to see him his long beard is becom-
ing white. Do you remember him with his long stick higher than himself and
his broad white collar over his shoulder?

Now my very precious boys I must say adieu for I have no more room. With a
very tender kiss and Christian love to your dear aunt and other teachers

                         I am your's affectionate
                                  Mama.
