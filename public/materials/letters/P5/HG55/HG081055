I enclose you a letter from David, who is always "a free and happy child".
Though he often repeats the words All my nature is unholy, pride and pas-
sion dwell within, he does not look much humbled by it. Mr Hebich sends you
plenty love. We wait anxiously for the Owen Glendower which brings to us
not indeed our dear boys, but at least their picture. How we shall like to
look at it. David will not go to Europe, except he get a whole box full of
sugar: and even with that promise he wept the other day most bitterly be-
cause Mama said, she could not go with him.

Well dear Sonele I hope you are happy without sugar, and obey aunt Culmann
and learn diligently that you may one day come and help us in our work.
Bella has little ones which David caresses and carries about as if they
were his own children. One little dog we sent to Helenele at Tellicherry,
was David zu ThrÑnen rÅhrte. Als ich von Tell. kam, begegnete ich 2 Giraf-
fen auf der Stra·e. Ich mu·te meinem Gaul das Gesicht bedecken sonst wÑre
ich nicht Åber die BrÅcke gekommen. Mama kÅ·t euch, und so thut
