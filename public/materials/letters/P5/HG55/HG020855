How glad I was to receive a letter from you and such a fine one, much bet-
ter than I could have expected It gives me much joy to hear that you pray
to the dear Lord Jesus for a new heart in order to return to us Yes I do
hope you will love the dear Saviour and serve Him and show this love in
obeying and loving your two aunts who are so very good and kind to you. It
is exceedingly kind too of the Dear Inspector to teach you every sunday I
hope you listen well and try to give answers.

I shall be very glad for you when ever you see your brothers and sister.
Your uncle Francois my brother will also soon pay you a visit. My precious
Frederic is getting such fine teeth I should like to see him, and you sweet
Vau how are yours, have you no more pain? David is as ever full of life and
always merry, he likes to hear about you, when I read him your letter yes-
terday he said give it me I will keep it well and kissed it. On sunday in
going to Cannanore he still runs under the big <Portuguese Mango>611 tree
where you used to hide yourselves and askes for "pasha" <gum Harz>611 You re-
member I dare say that fine tree near the Catchery. We never come near it
without thinking of our sweet Eddy and Vau who tried to frighten their papa
who passed by. We are also making the road in the same place where you did
help in carrying stones to papa who broke them We are also every day clean-
ing the compound, You remember how you did help me and the girls to pull
the bad grass. David is doing just the same with his mattock he digs every
where wrong and right making gardens in every direction. He is still very
fond of his Mimi. We have some new girls since you left, Dorcas is doing
the Maity's business. Priscilla will soon die, The blind Elisabeth is also
ill. We have tow little babas only a few days old, David likes them. All
the people here send you plenty Salams, Jacob, Nani, <Jette>611 Hanna, the
Missis, Gideon, Salome every one 88 persons would like to have their names
mentioned to you; but now enough Adieu my very dear sons

611David lÑ·t auch in der Regenzeit sein Wams hinten nicht knîpfen: so da· er
wie mit 2 FlÅgeln herumspringt und einen sonneverbrannten RÅcken hat.
Knîpft mans so macht ers bald wieder auf, so sehr ist ihm die Hitze zuwi-
der. Wir haben von Frau Foulis des Dr's Cacadu geschenkt erhalten Dieser
Cacadu hat den David recht lieb, wenn aber David ein HÅhnlein bringt und
ihm hinhÑlt so wird der schîne weisse Vogel schrîcklich bîse und alle seine
Federn strÑuben sich, da· er curios aussieht.

The Pullichi has got a fine calf the Acca from Aden gives more milk than
her Mama ever did. Wi·t ihr wessen Haar das ist: ihr habts ponmudi geheis-
sen, ist das nicht ein sonderbares Wort?
