Forts.: [19th April 1855]
It is the 19th April <1855>*, and this morning I got the pictures of your 2
brothers Hermann and Samuel. How they have grown Mama and I did no more
know them. Oh said she, now we ought also to have the pictures of dear Eddy
and sweet Vow. But I did not tell her, that I had ordered such pictures: I
want them to come before Mama even dreams of it. However I said, yes this
is a nice idea, we must get their pictures by and bye. - Only fancy dear
boys our good Doctor Foulis died very suddenly on the 10th of this month.
He was such a great help in all sickness, and so kind to the poor black
people, we shall not soon see his like here. Mrs Foulis was very sad, when
she came down from Coorg (for there she had been near Mr Mîgling, along
with her sister Mrs Young) and when she arrived and asked, he was already
buried for a whole day. Mr Hebich buried him, where you saw Christine bur-
ied, and he gave to all the people that crowded the burial ground a very
fine sermon. That was very easy, because all were very sorry, and knew that
Dr Foulis had loved Jesus, and served him with his whole heart, and so none
doubted in the least of his being now happy with his Lord. That is a fine
thing to be sure of. Dear boys try to get it for yourselves. When we buried
Mr Sandeman, Mr Foulis stood near his grave and felt at once, I shall soon
follow him: now he has done so. I am sure you will tell this news to Mrs
MÅller and BÅhler and Huber if they are near you

Da schicke ich auch noch alte Briefe von Paul, die im Cannanur Kasten (fÅr
die Sonntagskleider) niedergelegt waren. vielleicht liest er sie noch ein-
mal mit Lust und sucht sich die alten Erinnerungen zu bewahren und aufzu-
frischen. David ist ziemlich lustig, doch i·t er fast nichts, es ist zu
hei· - nur zu FrÅchten hat er Lust er grÅ·t euch herzlich und freut sich
Åberaus auf euer Bild. Der HErr behÅte Euch.

                       Mama kÅ·t euch wie auch Papa
