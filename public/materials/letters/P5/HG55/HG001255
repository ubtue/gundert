Forts.: Dec. 1855
I wrote to you two letters before, have you received them? I was very glad
to see the letters you wrote to papa and mama, you must be very diligent in
learning all what Miss Culman teaches you.

It will soon be a year that you have left Chirakal, do you still remember
me? I would be very glad if Paul would write a few lines to me and say if
he remembers me still, all the girls of the school send you plenty salaams.
also plenty salaams from Ruth, she asks if you talk sometimes about us? we
will be very glad to see your portraits, which the ship Owen Glendover is
bringing. David is very well and very happy, he learns well and is very af-
fectionate, - I send you plenty kisses and wish you may learn well and grow
strong and healthy. I remain your dear
