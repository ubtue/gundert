Forts.: 20 Nov 1856
You have given us a very great joy, with your two last letters. You are
very diligent dear Frederick to write two letters at once. I am glad to
hear, that you like school and are learning diligently; but above all I am
rejoiced to hear that you love your dear aunts, and like to please them in
being obedient. Papa and myself we are so thankful to hear such good news
from you, and our hope and prayer is that by and by you will also love the
Lord Jesus, and be obedient to him.

You are a happy child dear Frederick to have a loving aunt, when you be
once able to comprehend the love of the Lord Jesus to your own soul, you
will then follow Him, and even be more happy than at present. Some one has
told me, that you are already keeping playthings for David, when he comes
home. it is very kind of you, poor fellow he is rather selfish, and does
not like to keep anything for any one; but for himself, I am sorry to say,
however I hope he will learn better when he comes to Basle, he is not idle
to learn; but he likes to do it in his own way, and likes to be his own
master, he is very fond of gardening with his papa, he imitates him wonder-
fully in cutting branches and breaking stones in mending the road. Can you
read yourselves the english letters we send you? Which are your best
friends at school? tell me, I mean in the Kinderhouse I am glad that Her-
manle Amman will go with David, he is a fine boy, and I hope they will re-
main good friends. What do you hear from Marie and your brothers at Stutt-
gart? they will soon come to see you after David has come to Basle, that
will be a great joy, to meet each other, will it not? I would like to be
witness of that joy; but the joy of meeting in heaven will be a much great-
er joy, and none of us shall miss it I hope. Now my precious Frederick re-
ceive a tender kiss from your Mama
