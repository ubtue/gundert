What a very agreable surprise I had the other day when papa showed me your
portrait and gave me your letter; We could scarcely recongnise you and Ma-
rie not better than yourselves. And what a pretty bag or sack I have re-
cieved Is it indeed your making? I keep it as a very precious souvenir, has
Paul worked any thing in it and what is the part my Frederic has done? I
thank you very much for it. I am much pleased to hear that you are learning
pretty well, I hope that soon my sweet Paul will become dilligent. Imagine
what David said when he heard that Paul is still idle, "Well if Paul is
idle I cannot love him" If you are not running quickly after Frederic David
will come between you and you will be the last. He wanted to write and
thank you for the nice little books you have kindly sent him; but there is
no time remaining for we are already late.

My very dear sweet boys I send you plenty kisses
