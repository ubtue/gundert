To your favor of the 28th May (which was forwarded to me from Cann) I has-
ten to give at once a full reply. I ought perhaps first to have consulted
my brethren in Malabar, but you may depend on the facts being as I state
them, whatever the inclinations of the brethren may be.

1.) We Basel Missionaries have undertaken a new translation of the Malaya-
lam Scriptures, when we found (during the years 1849-51) that there was no
prospect of our joining in the Revision labors of the brethren in the South
Mal. country. We have now the N.T. finished and nearly the whole of it li-
thographed, the expense being borne by the Basle Bible Society.

2. We would no doubt gladly unite with the Miss[ionar]y brethren in Travan-
core to procure a revised Edition of the Mal. Scriptures. But our circum-
stances have of late changed so much that we cannot see whom to depute for
the work. For 2 of our old hands (F MÅller of Tell and J Huber of Cal.)
left last year for Europe, and I have been - temporarily I trust, trans-
ferred to the Canara Mission, so that for the present our Malabar Mission-
aries can hardly engage in any extra labor.

3. I have not the least doubt that the Malayalim Bible can be adapted
equally for the use of the Northern and Southern population. For the litt-
erature of the heathen in both parts is the same, and the dialectic differ-
ences are not greater than those existing f.i. between Tamulians of Madras
and Pandians.
