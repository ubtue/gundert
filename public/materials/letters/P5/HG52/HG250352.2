Many thanks for your two last letters which came to me last night.

Joseph has written to his wife that the plates which our children use are
now plentious at Mang and rather cheap, if so be so kind as to order him to
buy 12 small ones and 4 of a middle size. I shall than use the cupper ones
which the girls have at present for a diffrent purpose as they continually
require to be tinnd* I do not want any large one. and 16 together shall be
enough.

I thank you for all the news you gave Mr Fritz will tell you how well we
are all. Il me parait que Mr Fritz a de la galle la mˆme iruption que ses
enfans prends garde … toi. My love to all specially the Dear Weigles, Moeg.
