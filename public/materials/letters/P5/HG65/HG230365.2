We have had several letters from you of late all pleased me well, the Lord
does not leave you alone but again and again knocks at your heart and gives
you also some blessing.

Now that you have the prospect of living afterward with Onkel Adolph I
would beg you dear son to employe the time you have still in tante s house
in learning frensch as much as possible you cannot afterward get such a
good opportunity, try David with you to have one hour with Leon as often as
possible or with your friend Paul.

Mr Wirz has sent your black tuch I trust it will be enough it is only a
little bit more than three yeards, I will send it to day to the tailor, but
I dare say he will not be able to make it very soon because he has much to
do on account of the confirmation. are you in a hurry about it? You have
see the parrot Mrs. Sheffel brought from Basle, poor thing was nearly
dying. he poured down the lampe full of Earthoil upon himself brocke it of
course and he was for a moment alone covered with the glass and oil. When
Martha entered the room she heard the poor fellow groaning one washed him
well, he looked very sad, but now he eats again, and one hopes he will
live.

Now I must say Adieu. Give my love to all in your house

611Jetzt bin ich mit dem halben lexicon fertig. Es ist aber eine harte Arbeit
gewesen. Am Sonntag war der Basler MÅller noch Abends bei uns, der dann
Briefe nach Basel mitnahm. Herr Dr Krapf hat mir auch geschrieben als neuer
Vetter; la· Dir die Verwandtschaft gelegentlich erklÑren. Man kommt in ganz
neue "hîhere Kreise" hinein!

Auch noch herzlichen Gru· an Theod, dem gib die gemalte Beilage fÅr seine
MÑdle
