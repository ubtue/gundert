Your box of dirty cloth has arrived. Since I read your letter in Deutsch I
have much more joy to hear from you. It would have been very nice if you
had been here with Paul, we were together to Stamheim and Zafelstein. He is
very thin poor Paul and does not look well at all although he says that he
is well! It is already long since I saw the WÅrzes. He is in Berlin with
Fritz Wîhrle We have many visits friends who pass bey. 621Eben kommt FrÑulein
Buser, daher Mama nicht schlie·en kann.
