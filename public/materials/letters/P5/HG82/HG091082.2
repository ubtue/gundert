We have a serious business before us. On Wednesday 9 1/2 AM I hope to ar-
rive at St with dear G Pfleid from Basle (now here) and Schauffler and we
shall try to settle something before the British ChargÇ d'Affaires (name
unknown). It is about the ground at Chovva which Heb bought and we (the
Mission) have to defend our rights agst the Raja of Chiracal. Now 1. ques-
tion. Could you not go to Col. Sweet and ask him if he would have the kind-
ness to accompany us to the Legation (if known there? or able to come) to
identify me and perhaps Schauffler (Pfleid he does not know by face, but
Pfl has a brother, Steuerverwalter at St.) 2. Would you - perhaps accompa-
nied by Col. Sw. ask at the legation, at what hour we could come (10 or 11
AM.?) to have our affidavits signed and sealed etc before the big man. Try
to set about it sharp
