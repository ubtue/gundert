My dear

It is 2 PM and I have arrived at Bautzen where my host with partner has
come to fetch me. I found also Hesse here and Zahn from Bremen etc - only
for a moment, but it was nice to see the confluence for the feast. The lady
is from Montmirail and very pleasant. Also my compagnons in the waggon from
Chemnitz were Moravians and travelling in this direction

Goodbye then for the present and love to all, esp[eciall]y the musician!
