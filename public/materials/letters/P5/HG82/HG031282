Forts.: 3d Dec. <1882>*
This week we had no letter from you and in the last ones you did not speak
of your health, so that we conclude you are tolerably well, by Frederic we
heard that you can sleep well and eat with appetite.

I write only a few lines to wish you and all your dear ones a good new year
in which you and we learn to know more the Lord Jesus His ways with us
growing in grace and being very thankful. To day I thought what is love?
how can I love God? a thankful and joyful heart in Him is love, in grati-
tude serve and obey is easy. Do His will it be in trouble in sickness in
many trials, or in good days when all seems smooth, in gratitude all be-
comes possible.

May you have true joy in your family and in the congregation.

Much love to my dear Tine and to every one of your children. Also from Tan-
te Uranie with a good kiss
