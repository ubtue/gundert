An Frau Dr Gundert in Calw WÅrtemberg

                                                                   19/8 82611

I would only tell you that I passed a pretty good night and have my 2d cl.
trip behind me. As far as Reichenbach I went with Mrs. Wulfius of Dorpat
and her son, who saw much of Mrs Staatsrath Neue. In something like 6 hours
I hope to be at Bautzen where Mr G. is to meet me

                                  Goodbye
