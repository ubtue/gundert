Forts.: 24th October 1869
I have not yet thanked you for your well come note filled with good wishes
on my birthday, in which also you show that the Lord Jesus has become your
portion, so that you can say when the Lord Jesus who is my life shall ap-
pear I shall appear with Him in Glory. What a glorious promise is that if
we suffer with Him we shall reign with Him, yet, now for a while, hope, be-
lieve suffer and then in all eternity be with Him where we shall rest and
injoye.

Papa has no doubt told you all about our dear Paul who causes us great anx-
iety and grief, may God soon help him to see his error, it is really most
painful to see him.

Lately Julia with Ernst were here, she red some of your letters and was
much interested about you and yours, she feels much better than formerly,
however she caughs still pretty much, She has gained a little I think by
her illness. Theodor is with us I suppose that your two girls together
would not take up the time as he, he is just pulling me to play with him
and leaves me no rest, Your girls would help me giving me a stool instead
of pulling it away as the boy does, however one loves him, but he requires
a firm hand over him
