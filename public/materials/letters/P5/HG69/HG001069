We were much grieved to hear that dear Charles is so very poorly, may the
Lord help you both and comfort you making the pains and uneasiness tolera-
bel. We are often with you in the spirit. Theodor is nice and quite well. A
propos you had bought chins* for pinefore would you send it me to make them
and put them on, he would then spare his nice ones and not so often wash
them.

I find but one box of Cornflour

With much love to you all in the whole house
