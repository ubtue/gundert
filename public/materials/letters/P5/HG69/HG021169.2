Your laste has again given us joy specially to hear that dear Christina is
so nicely. I trust and pray that she has a good winter with you all the
Photografie of Julia brought by Mr Ward has given us much joy, and shows
Julia as having gained very much she ressembles her Mama, has some thing
fine and quieter than on the former, if she is as good, as diligent as her
dear mama surely papa and mama will be much pleased with her, and dear Ma-
riele we shall also get her once perhaps, we love both very much, and woold
like to see them playing with Theodor, who is a little selfish.

About our dear Paul you know everything, I have been much grieved and dis-
tressed about him, because I feared, that there was a high mind and a wish
to become a great person, but now I do not think so, he is very happy saw-
ing wood and will gladly do any kind of work, God will surely care for him
and make all right,

Adieu my dear Children kisses to you four
