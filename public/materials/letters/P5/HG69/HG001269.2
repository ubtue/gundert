Many thanks for all the news you gave us God be praised that dear Charles
is so tolerably, and both children so well, Many thanks too for the pres-
ents of Christmas. you should not have done it.

That God has helped with Paul you have already heard, and also for a serv-
ant girl.

Papa has a catarrh, but will however come on thursday to Stuttgart and
Kornthal at least we hope so. David will give you all the news about us
all.

With love to you all with kisses
