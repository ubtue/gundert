Accept my sincere thanks for the fine capute you have kindly sent me it is
indeed very pretty! As for the dress if Mrs W does not send it I would not
take it as I really do not want a dress; if she has forgotten it it is all
right I thank you just as if I had had it.

I send you herewith a letter of Marie Monnard.

I am glad to hear Theodor was so happy at his little things and that he did
not want to eat all at once sondern said aufheben, Charl Scheffel is de-
lighted with the soldiers you sent him. Apropos what is doing Zahn? Pere-
grina will be glad to get at last her children. Give my sincere love to
dear Mrs Isenberg to Jetthen and Albert.

We are very anxious to hear further from Frederic. Is now your little one
reconsiled for having no more milk from you, does he sleep better?

The goodle dit not tiry me the least all went on most quietly, as a play.
.
All the news about us you shall hear from Jettle.

With a hearty kiss
