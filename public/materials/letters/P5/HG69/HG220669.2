The dear Plebsts are with us, he has just had the mission meating in our
house, spoke nicely to the few ladies who were knitting, related simpel
facts how the hindous dress and live, all were pleased to hear him; our
dear Emma is the old Tantele, still nicer if it were possibel, our beloved
Emelie Muller enjoys them much and even learns Canarese a little with Emma,
besides that which she learns with papa, the more I see of her the more,
the more I value and appreciate her, a real fine perle,

The Plebst are going with papa to Bale next Saturday, after which they go
to Jagtsfeld to bathe. Mama did not come with them she fears the journey,
and is not yet quite well. That Anna has a girl you will already have
heard, both are quite well; Adolph also glad: though he expected a second
son. Mr Plebst has spoken us of a medecine you have in India called chloro-
dyne <das es gewi· auch hiezu Lande gibt>621 if you have once an opportunity
you might send us a small bottel <von etwas anderem>621. I am some time trou-
beld with diarhee, have you tried it? These last days we are warming the
ovens; for it is really cold, it has even frosen on the hills ice was found
in Samelet, and many things injured. one fears for the corn because it
rains much. These days I felt troubeld as if I had not cared for you well
as long as you were with the Wirzes, you should have had a better food and
wine etc I asked God to pardon me for having neglected you. So you see what
I am.

                       Adieu my very dear <Bubele>621.
