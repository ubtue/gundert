through Conrad we had already heard of Mr R. death before this inclosed ar-
rived.

I am thank God very well, we suppose that you may be detained longer in
Stutgart on account of the burying of Mr R. <Reihlen?>*

With love to all and best wishes on your speach in Canstat

Jettle has been very busy the whole day with wash which has got on slowly
Mrs Scheffel told us that Mr Widman is already in Stutgart, went to see Mr
Weigle yesterday.

I find the day terribly long because I am not permitted to work
