I got yours this morning after Heb. and brethren had gone to Chovva. - You
tell me not to bother myself with the box, your letter however is so full
of it to the exclusion of every thing else that I suppose you find it quite
a treasure. I have sent for it to the Customhouse after much search, and
hope they will give it out. Then I shall do my best to separate, but have
no doubt I shall make mistakes.

The MÅller's want, it seems, to go into the Compd of the Engl School and
have done with Heb's vicinity. M probably goes with Convert to Chomb to
meet Fr. there

I saw the Brigr this morning. Fancy the first royals that had come to Cann.
and were sent off to Masulipatam, were detained at Galle, and sent back to
this place - arrived yesterday - and after telegraphg to Madras they are
now to be sent 2back1 to Masulip. Crocker pretty well, perhaps goes home. -
Mrs West and Stevens visited Mrs MÅller, I did not see them. - Dear Youngs
arrived safely in Engld. Mrs Cummin writes cheerfully, sends also a Selam
to us and asks for letters from us or Mglgs - Dobbie returned from Birmah
to the hills, where his wife expects confinemt. <The Revd S. Hebich>611 got
this letter from dear Gompertz, but before we passed <Cannanore>611. - The
mail is in perhaps you have already letters. You may if you get this on
2Monday1 morning still answer it, if only in the course of Tuesday, I think
it will be too late.
