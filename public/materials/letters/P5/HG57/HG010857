Yesterday evening I arrived here. Mrs. Irion will not send the table cloths
2now1, and therefore no account ought to be sent at present. If Miss Chat-
field returns the one after trying the best to mend it. Mr Haller will have
to order what to do with it.

We have better weather this morning. I hope to leave at once and reach Ca-
licut at night. We are thinking of printing schoolbooks here, as the Cot-
tayam people are for a long time without paper and materials. Love to all
