Got the letters just as I was writing home. You received them it seems at
the same time. You say nothing of the 1st money I sent to Thomas (391) Did
he send that? Why can Ald. not send the other to Mr Bates to settle for
him? Strange you never knew to write Rhenius? Have you read the children's
letters? Nearly too much for a slow translator like Ald. I am annoyed with
this horsebusiness. No word at all about it. perhaps after all I must re-
turn to Cal without seeing Manant. - Convert left this morning by bandy in-
tending from Chomb to take a boat. Now farewell grace be with you - (write
also dates in your letters)
