Forts.: 10 Dec. <57>*
From Tuesday <8> morning to Wednesday <9 Dec> afternoon I was at Malapoo-
ram, read in the night with a candle stuck up on a inverted flowervase of
Thomas' and the candle melting the vase burst - wasn't it very stupid?!
Yesterday afternoon I came as far as a place called ________ where the Col-
lector has built a sort of stable for roving beings like myself. People
mistook me for a ____________ or I might have been left without milk Coo-
lies etc. Of course when at last asked point blank are you the Tuccudi; I
said: no but come from his house. The horsekeeper put on the belt with
great effect. It is an admirable contrivance. The cold awakened me early -
the fact is that is rather a high spot, and the hills (Sisipara ghaut) send
down T...r sharp winds. So I got up with the moon and descended from the
hill, where in the evening I had seen the lowlands lying before me as on a
map, and fancied for a while, how I should take a telescop and Mary with me
and explain every point. The march in the sort of half or 2/5 moonlight we
had was rather dreary, I arrived here with the Sun, Bossh. just putting on
his braces. He has only finished half the cheese you gave him (without my
permission) and has cut it straight through, yet have I been kind enough to
give him another. Tomorrow morning I will go on to Ponany and hope to find
there a letter which happiness is something future still on this excursion.
Beuttler is gone to the Miss[ionar]y Conference in the South, so I could
not visit him if I would. Probably I may see him when I go to Palghat D.V.

I visited Bean once or 2ce at Malap. he had heard much against Hebich
("from people who had for years been in the habit of hearing him") and
their impression that Heb was wanting in charity seems to be his - still he
esteems him and thinks perhaps more on the great question of earnest saving
faith than I could as yet perceive. Love to all. I know you pray for me and
I have you often on my mind in my slow progress
