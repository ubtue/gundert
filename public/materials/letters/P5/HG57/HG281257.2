Forts.: 28 Dec <57>*
Today overland mail, but no letters from Basle The Parsee says the party 2
gentlemen and 3 or 4 ladies landed on the 21st whereas you received the te-
legram only on the 23de - the baggage was conveyed to their houses the same
day - all live with Isenberg. Kaufm. laments they will probably not leave
Bomb in Dec but I hope they will as ordered by Pfleid make every possible
haste I hope also that tomorrow some letter or other will come and give us
news from Bombay direct. About Cacao Pfl knows nothing. Hadn't you written
to Marie about it? Grapes etc can be easily got I have got also a hat for
C. - What is that "Harry is expected next week" I know of no Harry. Of Han-
na <(Carrs)>* I hear that she lives with her brother - nothing else - I en-
quire but nobody takes the matter in hand, and I myself don't like to ap-
pear too anxious about it so matters are in a slow progress of manifesta-
tion. - Young Thomas I have not visited. Heb went to see him and was called
by him a mischief maker. Now I don't want such thanks and rather avoid get-
ting them. - Saw Fisher this morning. More distant I suppose than even be-
fore his going home. - He does not care much about education, consequently
the Tahsildars are rather careless about it if not directly hostile. - Yes-
terday I preached in Tamil to 8 or 10 people - dined with Degg's and talked
with him, he is the old fellow without any determination or desire for
work, spending the day in absolute idleness. She really nice. Gompertz and
the Dr <Brett>* came up in the evening. The former thinks of going to the
hills or somewhere else on Sick Certificate - being rather poorly and over-
worked. Nice letters from Goddard and McGrigor. The former is much more
calmed down. That case which Thompson and Mayne decided against the Mis-
sion, was at Madras given in its favor (concerning the Sandalwood of that
native merchant). All send plenty Selam So do I to every one
