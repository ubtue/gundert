Forts.: 22 Nov 57
Today your letter with Ernst's etc came also the news of Convert's arrival.
I then preached English - Misses Brown etc (whom I had yesterday evening
seen with their father at Brennen's) but Brennen himself does not come for
months. I had been talking to him yesterday when Brown came and interrupted
us - Br had said that he looked to Jesus alone and also prayed to him - Re-
turning from service I met the horse which HK had despatched on the 16th
only (instead of 12th) - so I hope D.V. to depart 23 evening, be 24th and
25th at Manantoddy - and may 227th1 early be at Elattur and in want of the
little pony for part of the way if nothing else is to be had. If delayed
Saturday morning (28th) will be the date. I shall now make haste - and if I
can, go already the following week off to Ponany and Malapuram, in order to
be by the middle of Dec at Mang if the next letters should hold out farther
hopes. Fr. is pretty well, will go to Heb. tomorrow - for hard work

Heb 2is1 certainly right, but he 2does1 many things very much against order and
union - f.i. his eternal buildings - I quite wonder how he ventures to do
it without money for at present he has nothing. the MÅller's won't stay at
Cann. except there be great changes, first in the house, then in labour. -
Every one here is against Richter getting Miss Schmidt. Would she not do
for Aldinger rather than what he may choose out of the 7-8 proposed to him.
I see Carr is better again. May the Lord help him and us all according to
His grace
