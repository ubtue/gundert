What a time we had to wait for your dear letter - and after all we only got
that from the Cape. ...611 You are, I fear now half English, half German and

don't know how to speak and how to write. I dreamt on the 4th of May <(auf
Pattimar vor Casergode)>, when the sea was rough and I turned many times on
my mattrass, that I met Mr and Mrs BÅhrer, also the other parents of the
children were behind me: When we came in to greet them, they looked so sad
and I asked: where are the children and they looked down; Mrs B. then
touched him as if to say you must tell it, and he looked at her as if to
entreat her to do it for him. Then she hid her face and showed with the
finger downwards. And I thought it possible the ship might have been wreck-
ed and the old people only saved. I therefore asked Mr Isenberg at Bombay
to telegraph to me about the ship: and on the 24th of June we heard that
the ship was off Brighton But on the 28th we read in the Home news that on-
ly 8 children arrived with the BÅhrer's, then Dr Brett was quite sure his
Johny must have died and he suffered much from it. We comforted him but
thought it very possible our David when playing the wild horse may have
jumped down the hatchway, or even tumbled overboard. Now we praise the Lord
Jesus who will have brought you safely to your 2 brothers and no doubt
gladdened your hearts by the visit of the big brothers and dear sister

Please dear boy, learn to believe in Jesus who loves children so much.
