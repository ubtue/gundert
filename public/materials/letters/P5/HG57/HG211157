Forts.: 21 Nov 57
No horse nor notice about it. I will now try to obtain a Manjil from Bren-
nen or where, and get bearers. Fritz is lying on the couch somewhat tired
from having taken one of his blue pills This morning I expect Mr Convert
will have arrived and told you of our news. Young Harley passed thro' this
morning, I have hardly seen him. The news about Mrs Holloway is still dis-
tressing. The Chatfields have gone to Mangalore. You say nothing about the
letters, if you read them or had them read to you I trust that Mary has set
out in spite of the protestation from Stuttgardt. Pfleid's bride may come
out at the same time, if his father has found one for him. Mîgl, I hear is
not accepted by the Church Mission. Kaund. likes Mang. again doubly after
his return from Coorg.

BÅhrer's letter very empty - Mrs BÅhler is reported by Mrs MÅller to be
truly fine and growing. Of the money I do not know - did Thomas send the
391 - but never mind I shall see when I return. How are you with regard to
the people? I should like to be soon down again from the Wynaud, otherwise
I can hardly visit Ponany and Malapuram before I shall have to go off for
Manantoddy. Fritz will on Monday go off to Cann. for his business there -
hard work I fear. Now farewell, the Lord with you and
.fo -
                                                   Yours HG.

The old horsekeeper wants again to serve and would even return to Mangalore
it seems, Changara becomes perhaps Mrs MÅller's servant.
