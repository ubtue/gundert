I have not written yesterday because all was well. Mrs. Hoch decidedly bet-
ter it appears so they will not be obliged to leave this place at least we
hope so.

Many thanks for yours of the 5th Thursday, all the people were at the meet-
ing except Carr who had drill very late at night and again early the morn-
ing; He comes some time to hear about you and Mrs. Hoch. The Dr. is still
in his unbelieving way, Yetty is almost always ill, inquire after her Sis-
ter Charly when you come and after the Edgings Mrs Stevens has from me. ask
Mrs Diez about them and if she she has not got the money 8 Rs let Mrs Ste-
vens give back the Edgings!

I am glad to hear you return so soon towards the north. I have been obliged
to punish Lydia severely for her touching everythings. My love to all I re-
joice to hear Sister Fritz and baby are doing well, Special love to Jacob
and Rachell and at Chovay, Cananore, Cherical

Here all is as usual, we are very glad to see the sun now and than.

I am going to the meeting down - and then will pay a visit to Miss Will and
to the girls.

You are very dilligent in writing. I thank you heartily for it and though
some time it is but a few lines I am truly very thankful. May you have a
good day and the presence of our dear Lord continually
