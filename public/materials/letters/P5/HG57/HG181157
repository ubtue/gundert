1. Datum von Hermann Gunderts Hand.
As I did not know that you would go through Tellicherry, I have sent off
yesterday a letter to Manontoddy. I trust the letters of our children will
reach you at Tell since you say I may answer yours of the 17th I venjure to
send you all I have no news, except that Harly came to day to meet his
brother whom you saw. I have advised him to go to see Mr Hebich and hear
from him how he may be converted, he then said he would go to Reihnious
<Rhenius>* and escape H. We then tried Aldinger and I to speak to him; but
he tooks set on the world;

The two Schmidts came for dinnar with him, I told them that I would like
their sisters to spend a day with me and the Mama too, I have promised P.
to try to see a little of them. I shall let her know what you say on the
subject. A letter from Mrs Leslie asking table clothes etc. I have sent her
order to Mangalore

When do think of coming back? Schmidt said that he had heard of Mrs Hollo-
way having had a fall fom a window 12 feet high, but he knew nothing more
nor have I heard any thing more. I see no one nor hear from any one Thomas
is not here nor Robinson Aldinger could not get the Money; but I have
enough with out it. Now Adieu
