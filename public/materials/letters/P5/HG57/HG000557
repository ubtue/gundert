Now, 2middle of May 571 you ought to be at Basle, and I half believe you are
there I had a bad dream in my Pattimar on the 4th of May, as if I met Mr
and Mrs BÅhrer and asked them after my David, but they would not or could
not tell. Then I thought that is all nonsense, the dear Lord has brought
you safely home, and only because I have seasickness my stomach plays some
trick to my head. -

Dear Mama is now very much alone, therefore we want sister Mary to come out
and bear her company. I have been at Cochin and saw 5 ships at anchor, but
the Seringapatam was not amongst them. Then I paid a visit to Mr Beutler
and he told me how he saw you on board the ship and you and Adele Fritz
asked him, to take you on shore, as you liked rather to stop in India, than
go to Europe. I hope you now like Europe. It will soon be very fine with
Cherries and berrys and every kind. You have heard Zacharias ate berries in
the Coorg jungle and died of Cholera. Also Hermann the brother of Annie
died there

 ...611 Now good bye and the Lord keep you.
