I was glad to hear of the Telegr, after the Dr had already yesterday an-
nounced that the steamer arrived on the 21st. Evidently they must have de-
layed telegraphg to you because of other (Governmt's) work. - I am glad if
all went off to R's satisfaction. He is very sanguine, but I hope the final
decision of Mrs. S. was in keeping with the first reception for tea. Excuse
me with him, please, I cannot write just now having to settle many school-
matters. Perhaps I shall have to go to Karcal, and must delay it till Mary
arrives lest I miss her the day of the landing.

The thread I gave to Pfl. The iron mortar sought, but not yet found. Must
we perhaps empty the great box for it? Degg. is still angry that his wife
alone has been wished for, not he - he has been very cross to her occasion-
ally. Chatfield visited me today, very condescending. No more news.
