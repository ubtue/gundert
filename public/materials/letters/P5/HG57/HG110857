As I have no time to send you this letter of Mrs Young I have but time to
say that here all is as usual. Mrs Hoch is now to be for some days with out
remedy if she does not get stronger she will have to go to Coimbatoor She
has had a good deal of Colomel and her stools are somewhat better we must
wait to see how it will be without medecine.

Yesterday and to day no letter from you, but it may still come. Your last
was from Malapuram. Adieu dear papa a few days and we get home news I hope
