I wait with writing German until I hear that you know it better than Eng-
lish. When you are once at Basle I will tell you what I dreamt on the 4th

day (1st June) from the North. ...611 He sends plenty love to you.

Ebenezer writs now with Mr Pfleiderer, he copies letters and makes ac-
counts, and has got a gentlemens topi. (You know topi? _____ something like
this) ...611

I wish I could now cut and saw trees with you: but you are better where you
are and may the dear Lord bless you.
