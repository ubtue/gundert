Along with these came one from Mr Pleiderer about account which I keep.
None from our dear Children as yet; but they may still come. As these are
just 3 as postage I send them without delay. Fritz left this, this morning
at 4 o'cl Saturday, he was very sad and cast down as if he should not see
the place again. Yesterday Mr and Mrs Wells colled here. The two younster
Smidt too and drank tea.

I was so tired yesterday that I could not finish this and had some hope
other letters might come; but it seems they have all been sent through Ma-
dras so we must wait a little longer. We had just now a good word from Al-
dinger; may the people have opened ears, and thurst and hunger; may we our-
selves be always such we shall then taking from His fulness grace for grace
have at all times have a word of life for all those we meet. The Lord is
very Good to me; and makes the way smooth and easy. The beautiful prayer of
Paul for the Ephe is also for us, may we know much of that exceeding great-
ness of his power working with in us and throug us to His praise and Glory.

I just receive your two letters at once for which many thanks As I see by
Mrs Moegs letter that we can send letters as formerly that is to say as
written papers I send you all I have in that way and hope it will reach you
at Cannanore all safe. I am much rejoiced to hear of Capt Taylor and his
dear wife

I am very sorry to have buthered you with the box I should have left it
come here without a word! pardon please. Love to all

Aldiger got a few lines from Fritz very much cast down and low spirited I
trust he will get better at T where just now they have a good time says Al-
diger I had heard that the Muller do not like the house, there is plenty
smoke said Glassen.

Did you know there was a talk or perhaps only a thought in Fritz to ex-
change this place for Chombala? I heard it from Albert611 it was perhaps he
knew we would come! Now excuse this scribble from
