Yours of the 2d reached me yesterday. I am very sorry that H.<och?>* in-
stead of seeking a heart's conversion permitted the Devil thus to lead him
by the nose. S<eb>* M<ller(?)>* as I suspected, knew of it. Not the name,
but H<aller(?)>* wrote to him that for many reasons he thought it better to
marry a native, and that he had found one fitted for him, loving her Savior
in all simplicity, but not yet acquaninted with his sentiments for her. M.
half dissuaded him from it, seeing that there would be many difficulties in
such a case. I hope however that the brethren have looked at the matter in
too dark a light. What correspondence f.i. could he carry on - in English
or Canarese? Certainly he must in all such undertakings have been convinced
before hand, that there was danger in such correspondence, and I should
therefore have rather wished the one letter of which there was evidence had
been read and well understood, rather than torn. I thought for a moment:
should I advise a speedy marriage? H. has permission - the Comm. will not
be so much against it as the brethren of the Station. Only no hubbub for
such causes! Therefore let there be a calm consultation and then advice
ought to be given as to what is to be done. - Dear G. is rather cast down
about the family, he feels interested in. Today he preached Christ for one
hour and 1/2 to them: but he will follow my advice and go farther north-
wards. For he sees of course that such intercourse must not be indefinitely
prolonged. Tomorrow therefore he will move on. I am to go this evening with
SM to Soonksal - I shall make haste to get over the ground. Here I saw Tah-
sildar etc about school - My companion <S. Mller>* ist not yet converted
as far as I can see. God keep you and let his face shine on all that seek
him
