Many thanks for your last which as ever has given us joy, Uranie was much
pleased to have a few lines from yourself direct, usually Jettle is so good
as to translate your letters to her which is a treat for her, for she likes
to hear news, and all our dear peopel take much troubel to talk with her in
frensh and relate her that which might interest her. Papa ist so good to
her speaks almost always frensh when she is present, and during her ilness
prayed twice every day with her which was for us both of a great blessing,
Before Uranie came to us I felt rather anxious because of the language; for
she is rather suseptibel and easily discouraged, but thank God til now it
is much better than I could have expected, Only lately once I percieved
that she looked dark and displeased, I felt at once she had been neglected,
we had had visits and the whole conversation was in German, and I am such a
poor creature that I can not really relate things not even after a meeting
or a talk, if papa and Jettle were not here she would be to be pitied. Now
enough on this. Your dear Emmale is such joy to you all. I fancy to see you
laying on the flowr and her pulling you, or opening her Mamas eyes We re-
joice for you over this Gift of God. And that you have some reason to thank
God for His work in some members of the congregation gives us joy; it is
that especially which we ask our Lord, May He create life in many poring
down His holy spirit, though it should be but on a few. May He also keep
your dear children from the world, and spare you the many grieves which
others have in this respect; how good has been the Lord to us in keeping
our children.

Much love to dear Mama to the three daughters with kisses to all

bei mir an ob meine Sîhne Herm Fried Dav noch ledig, oder wo und wann ver-
heirathet seien, welchen Beruf sie wÑhlten, seit wann selbstÑndig, wo sie
sich seit VolljÑhrigkeit aufhalten? Ich beantwortete nach bestem Wissen,
erwarte Forderung von 2 Mk jÑhrlich BÅrgersteuer mîglicherweise lÑngerher,
(dann 1 Fl per Jahr). Frage: soll ichs zahlen? Ich schiebe jedenfalls hin-
aus, vielleicht fragen sie Dich selbst. Doch solltest Du nicht Åberrumpelt
werden. Die Stuttg Steuern sind 2 und 3mal so gro· als die Staatssteuern,
daher sie sich jetzt auf alle mîgliche Einnahmsquellen besinnen
