It seems to me to be a long time since I have written to you, we are how-
ever not so strangers; for we love one an other and are often in spirit to-
gether at least when we pray for each other. In seing the little ones of
Marie and Emma we think of yours, he would probably love his Grandpapa as
much as these two do if he could see him and feel his love Liesele is in-
chanted with him she likes especially to get the last spoon ful of his caf-
fee, she opends already before hand her mouth to get her portion, Herman
Hesse is some what spoiled or fancys himself neglected if not always carryd
about, his illness is the cause of it, but so are all children after having
been cared for during an illness, as for me I cannot carry him he is too
heavy, Adelle is a very fine child not exigent at all, she can amuse her-
self with any thing. Julia is not so good, she can scream if not near her
mother, Theodor and Carl we do not see often Carl is such a dreamer that he
sees no one enter the room with out taking notice of any one, but he learns
very well,
