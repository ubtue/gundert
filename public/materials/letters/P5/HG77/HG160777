We have thought again about the matter of Uranie's money and think that
there is no need of any thing being mentioned except what she has placed in
German funds through Fred.

Yesterday I was at Hirsau, where Jettle accompanied me with Fred. Marie is
well, though not yet quite able to write. John has been at Stammh. to
preach and Sophie went along.

Fred goes on pretty well, the children all quite swimmingly. I send but
love to Uranie and also her paper which arrived yesterday. We are thinking
of an excursion to Liebenzell where Pf Schott is as also Prof. Fischer. The
former came here this morning and thinks that Ammann has not been received
in the new class of Missionary students.

Christine continues to cook well, yesterday a new cherry cake!

May God keep you cheerful under all changes of weather and circumstances,
and may dear Uranie derive a real benefit from the baths, is the hearty
wish of
