Many thanks for your kind letter and good wishes, and what shall I say for
the beautiful present you made me through David I thank you very much, it
is a fine and useful work of yours. you shall have occasion often to see
how needful it was and therefore double welcome.

So your sons had such great joy I am glad for them and for you, the vacance
will be kept in remembrance by the little ones, I am sorry to hear Mrs
Isenberg is unwell please give her my love as well as to Peregrina and
Jetthen.

If you come on Friday you shall be well come and can well do without your
Sarah till she comes.

Yesterday evening we had Mr Buser and Wîhrle to supper Mrs W. could not
come, Mrs Heerman with Marie and Mss SchÅz were also to come; and how sur-
prised were we to see Julie coming instead of Mama who would remain with
her husband who had just arrived unexpected from Heidelberg, they have been
here to day, papa mama and daughters, they were pleased to see their chil-
dren, their house and all that which consern them. Those of Ludwigshaven
came sunday they went together on the Schloss, drunk caffee in the garden,
Monday Emma heard that the Verners Professor would come to day for a few
days, as Mr H. had already made up his mind to return Tuesday they accepted
the visit from Stutgart

It is nice that you have such fine weather you can be out the whole day, We
long much to hear from America.

With love to 2all1 our dear peopel and kisses to you and Theodor and Carl

                          I remain yours affectly
