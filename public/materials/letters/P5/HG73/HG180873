In order not to lose another 2 pce I hasten to acknowledge the receipt of
your card. You ought to have stamped it as mine is. Glad to hear of having
accomplished the different tasks so far. Fr. writes joyfully from Bale and
Davy finds that the new husbd marches very respectably across mountain
passes. The children with Tine passed the afternoon cheerfully at the
Stonehouse, after having heard me in a solemn place. Aunt Hanna is said to
have written, plenty news about Major's movements etc
