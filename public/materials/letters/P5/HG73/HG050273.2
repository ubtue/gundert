Yes dear Tinne your husband has told you right that we shall laugh from joy
to see you when you come, You shall find I trust father mother brothers
sisters who love you in truth, I already imagine to see Julie and Marie
helping me in the house keeping, dressing the tabel, taking away the plates
after dinnar, and taking a long walk after dinnar with their Grandpapa who
walks daily. I shall be so glad to rest a little and see my granddaughters
take a part of my task. Tante Uranie shall be very glad to have some one
who will learn and talk french with her; for she has often heimweh because
of the language, she loves children very much. Carl feels it and caresses
her often saying "ma chäre tante ich liebe dich."

You know dear children that roses are not without thorns so you and our-
selves are to keep that in mind and give thanks for all.

We shall be glad to hear from you how you have found my brother with fami-
lies, whether frederic think really to come to Europe and at what time. Now
with a tender kiss to each of you I remain
