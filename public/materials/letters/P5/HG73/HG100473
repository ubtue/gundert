Forts.: 10 April 73.
As by the death of Mr Ch Young, 8 Highstreet, Islington, the Calwer Ver-
lagsverein (called by the late Dr Barth, German & Foreign Schoolbook Socie-
ty) has lost its agent for Engld, that served it for about 40 years, I wish
to ask you whether you would kindly undertake this service. It consists
chiefly in sending me a monthly parcel of Miss[iona]ry and other publica-
tions, as well as books, also casts to be obtained from the British pub-
lishers for our German papers.

In the hope that you will have the kindness to accede to our proposal, I
will at once enter into particulars. The papers which I wish to be sent to
my address Dr HG Calw, WÅrtbg, once a month, are written in the annexed
list. Several of them were given gratis by diffrt Societies, but I have
never had a specified account of them.

A parcel from the Rel Tract Society was sent to Mr Young every month & ad-
ded to that which he forwarded to Calw. I beg Dr Davis in the enclosed to
let you have the parcel for March & April, which are now due. <Yearly Re-
ports>

The account with Mr Young was kept in this wise: he received for me a year-
ly sum of ú 15- which the London Missy Socy pay through me to a son of the
late Missry J. Lechler. when needful I sent bills over. From time <up> to
time he sent me an account of his expenses, <the last in July 1872 which
closed with a balance of ú.2.17.5 in my favor. What balance may now be in
the widow's hand I do not know exactly but as Mr Young drew in July the
above sum of 15 ús, he must have then had about 17 ús in hand. As the year-
ly expense for Magazines, casts, books etc. averaged about 18 ú,>621 There
must now be some balance in my favor with Mrs Y. <but as she>611

But as Mrs. Young appears unable to enter into business questions about the
accounts I do not wish her to be troubled with.

I have written to Mr J. MÅller, Basle Mission to ask him if you accept my
proposal, to supply you with the funds, that may be required in addition to
the above sum of ú 15- per annum. The latter will come in about July

This is all I think needful for the present. In the hope of a favorable
answer
