I am really sorry for you that you shall have much troubel for Uranie as
they come so late the evening You will be so kind dear Frederic to take a
Einspenerle to take them home as it is rather far to your house from the
termine, I beg dear Emma not to remain up so long and take care of herself.
If Uranie will see the schloss one must take a carriage; for she could not
walk and she likes to see new things. I only fear for your troubel.

Give them please my love You will know the best time for them to come on
Monday at noon ore early the morning, they better come by Stutgart, <Zuf-
fenhausen>611 Uranie likes the 3d class more than the second with a pillow
she sits more comfortabel she told me last year; but you shall hear from
them, I know you will care for them and I thank you heartily for it

Adieu my dear Children

                            Yours affectly JG.

Love to dear Marie and to her boys
