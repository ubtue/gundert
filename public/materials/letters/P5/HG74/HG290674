Many thanks for your last which has given me much joy. Now that you have
the Lord you can discern the different spirits with whom you meet, the Lord
is very gracious to you giving you out of His fulness grace for grace. You
want much wisdom to deal with so many curious peopel and hither to you have
been kept and lead murvelously, to our Lord and father be praise.

I have been at Wildbad with Uranie three weeks it has done her good, she
had much joy to have your letter translated to her by Marie, she sends you
all much love, she remains still a few weeks, then will return to Cor-
celles, Frederic is not yet better, it seems the care for his son troubels
him. We have much rain these days, and it is not warm, I am alone with Ura-
nie as papa and Hesse are in Bale Jettle in Heidelberg, we have wash to in-
turrupt the happy rest I had three days, David will soon come it appears he
has already left his place, will travel to Hamburg, Barmen etc. and from
Heidelberg come to us, In your last you did not say any thing of dear Tin-
nes health I trust that she is well with your two beloved daughters, to
whom and Mama and yourself I send hearty love and kisses

                              Yours affectly
