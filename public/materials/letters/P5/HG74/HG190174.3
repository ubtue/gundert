Forts.: 19 Jan 74
I was rejoiced to hear that the Mrs Yungs were so much pleased of their
staying with you, your mornings and evening prayers in which you rememberd
those for whom they had come there has specially touched them, So my dear
children by your hospitality you had opportunity to give witness to your
Lord. Yea the Lord be praised for this grace which He gave you.

I was also very glad to hear in secret from Marie Heerman that the hopes
have not been disapointed till now; but however we keep it for ourselves!
leaving this as all our concerns in our Lords cares.

We are in expectation to see Mrs. Hesse with her younger son who is to re-
main in Calw for some time. Thats right of you dear Emma to give courage to
Anna S in telling her that your meat and vegetabel had not succeeded well
it is no small thing to be timide and easily cast down

May the Lord bless you both to His praise

to have you near
