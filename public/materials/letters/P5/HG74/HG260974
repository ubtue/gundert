I was very glad to hear that dear Emmas brea[s]t is better, If the baby
wants breile here with are Zweebach for her and those who like them I sup-
pose that Mama with her Julie and Tante Marie injoye this beautiful weather
in the Garden, and I hope that it profit them. This morning I sow the litt-
le SchnÅrle who very likely is not bigger at 10 weeks old than yours at 4,
he is so very thin that it pains one to look at it, and he crys a great
deal, they feed him with milk mixed with bouillon and greas <rolon> breile,
this sort of brei seems to me rather heavy, but every one has its way. It
is a great favour and Gluck if a mother can nurse, So we will thank God
that dear Emma can do it; but wait not too long to give the baby something
beside your milk

With hearty love from us all I remain with a tender kiss

Perhaps dear Marie could bring me back the box or by anny other opportunity
