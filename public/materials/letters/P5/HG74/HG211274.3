It is already a long time since I wrote to you. I have always a great joy
to hear your letters Yes dear Frederle a true joy to hear you relating of
your dear wife of your darling. The Lord is gracious to you both to Him be
glory and thanks and should there come other days in which He would appear
less gracious by faith you would have grace to say it is all well all
things work together for our best, yea for our best our father will see in
us the image of His son and to bring this to pass He knows which are the
best means therefore we learn to say with our whole heart thy will be done

Last year we had the joy to see you in our midst; and now the queen in your
house keeps you, it is all right till she may come in company. We are how-
ever in thoughts together and our wishes for one another come to our heav-
enly father,

May the Lord bless you both richly, with your child, and make you a bless-
ing for others, Adieu my very dear Children

with a tender kiss to you three
