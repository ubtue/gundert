Forts.: 28th June <1874>*
Though we had many peopel from India I have not heard a word about you,
when Stolz was here with Wengert I was in Wildbad and when Muller came he
was so very tired that he went to bed half an hour after his arival in or-
der to leave here at 10 the evening to go to Nagold with papa, however he
felt so weak and tired that he remained in bed till next morning then went
to Bale. he looks weak and miserabel, Lauffer who was here too seems to be
the same as of old, he is cured it appears of his old complaint, and speaks
of returning to India leaving 8 children here, taking the youngest with
them

I have been three weeks in Wildbad with Uranie she injoyd it, it seems that
it has done her good, I am glad to be again at home. This week we are alone
Uranie myself and the servant girl, papa and Hesse in Bale Jettle in Hei-
delberg Marie with her children is here too; but they have their house hold
for themselves, the boys are growing, going to school so that one hears
less of them or of noise, I have just heard a good preaching of Helfer
Grill, This morning I read in Steinhofer some thing on prayer after I had
just been thinking how difficult it is to watch and pray. inspite of so
many exortations to pray without ceasing, to be watchful un* to prayer.
Sthofer gives the exemple of Jesus getting up early to pray among other
things he says "Manchmal sind wir ganz nahe an der Salbung der gîttlichen
Kraft, die wir erlangen solten, und wir halten uns nur nicht als leere ge-
fÑsse so lange hin; bis wir gefÅllet sind. Daher haben wir das wahrzuneh-
men, dass wenn wir uns gleichsam zum gebet wollen gÅrten, wir bedenken, das
Jesus in allem anliegen gebetet habe, dass er die ganze nacht darinnen an-
gehalten

Wer einmal ans herz Jesu so gewîhnt ist, dass er alle seine besonderen Um-
stÑnde mit Him ausmachen can, in der einsamkeit mit gebet und flehen, und
so lange darinn anhÑlt, bis er weiss, was sein wohlgefÑlliger Sinn darinnen
ist, und nun dasselbe in seiner gemeinschaft ausrichten und behandeln can,
so ists gethan, wie es gethan seyn sollte, wie es dem fater gefÑllt.

After the Bibel I find nothing like Steinho works specially on Rîmer and on
the Epistel of John.

With us it rains much, and though it is not very warm things grow rapidly

With a hearty kiss to each of you and love to all those who remember us I
remain yours affly

Much love from Uranie
