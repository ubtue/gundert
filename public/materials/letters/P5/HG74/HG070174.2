I want you to see, what Theod has written to congratulate his parents on
New years day (drauf stand: Gott schenke euch Kraft und Gesundheit, Weis-
heit und Geduld etc). When I asked him, whether God has not already given
us 2enough1  of patience, or whether they both, Carl and Theod foresaw that
they would try our patience yet more in this year, so that we required a
new measure of it, he merely laughed. They write these wishes in the school
and copy from a letter printed or written by the master. I wonder what you
said to Papa and Mama? Have you also the word: "Prosits Neu Jahr" That is
what I wish to you and sister. Prosit, which means: may you profit by the
new year in all respects! We wish you had also some of our goodies. But I
think your Mama gives you the best.
