Forts.: <6. Dec 74>*
The letters of Julie and Marie have caused us much joy; all that which they
say and relate has amused and pleased us; has one of them reveiled us a se-
cret? is indeed a Samuel or a Tinne expected? how glad would we be if the
Lord would give you such joy. Tinne is a very fine name the mother of papa
was called so. Dear Julia would like to know which play the Lord did. I
think the plays which you have, if you have His presence now and then are
right. I dare say He had to suffer from other children, as he had afterward
when grown up from His own brothers.

We feel very thankful to the Lord that the health of dear Tinne is so good,
we hope her hands will remain well during the winter.

Rikele was glad to hear her name mentioned by you, she sends kind regards
she has less to do since Johanes has left us. Marie likes her own house-
keeping she feeds her husband so well that he shall perhaps do like Frede-
ric who is becoming very staut, peopel in Calw were quite astonished to see
him at Maries wedding he may become like his Uncles or papa, their Julia
gives them much joy, their letters are full of praise.

With much love and hearty kisses to every one of you

The copper vessel which you gave us has been very useful and appreciated
