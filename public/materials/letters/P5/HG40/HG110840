Forts.: 11th August 1840
Michael Vellay has enticed away two of my Pooliar young men whom he has
taught their tasks* I suppose, for the purpose of uttering accusations
against me. From the circumstances that have transpired against Michael
Vellay, whatever these boys can say, can be no extenuation of what he is
accused of; nor any guarantee for his having conducted himself in the man-
ner he has done amongst his flock - I am confident your good sense will see
the drift of this conspiracy forming against me, their master, and that it
is actrialed* by - maliceous vindictiveness.

I hope Mrs Gundert and the Infant are both doing well
.
                                 Yours truly
                                         J. Brown

Mr. Hibesh <Hebich>* left this at 9 o'clock, rather a bad time for travell-
ing, and the day has been sunny. I hope however, he will reach home quite
well. I was pleased with his conversation.
