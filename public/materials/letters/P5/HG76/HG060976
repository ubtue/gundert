Forts.: 6 Sept 76
By your last letter I hear that you are all well, Mama and baby specially,
I fancy to see dear tender Julia much grieved at having let the baby knock
against the piano and how careful she will be in future, but especially
pray to the Lord to keep the dear Emma. Today is Adele very ill, Diarehe,
vomiting with fever, and not withstanding very amiable trying to smile if
Emmale should be ill like Adele Julia and Marie would surely cry, weep
loud, and would I think pray to God for the baby that she may get well
again, but if the Lord will take the baby away, what should we do believe
that He makes all well surely He loves the child better than ourselves and
knows what is right; so we should but humble ourselves and kiss the hand
which takes away any thing from us believing God will give me something
better still. Mama has much help from her two big daughters who will show
their love by serving, Monday Adele is better from having changed her food
the white of an egg with hot water instead of Milk

Adieu my dear Children. Let Jesus be the first and last with you all
