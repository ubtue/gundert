Forts.: <26./27 Nov. 76>*
Your last letter relating of the old papa <(Huá)>* has given us much joy;
for there is nothing like to see tears of repentance, I fancy to see dear
Tine weeping for joy that at last the heart of the old man is getting soft,
I rejoice for you it is a token for you, your labour is not in vain, May
you see fruits also in the congregation, Surely the Lord will bless His
word which is preached faithfully in love There is no joy like the one to
see poor sinners to come to Jesus, that they have been brave or wicked men
are sinner and must be converted to enter in the kingdom. May the old papa
become a Child and give up all that which does not fitt a true Christian.

We wish you joy and peace in the coming days in your family and in the con-
gregation That with the new year new life may be communicated.

With a hearty kiss to each of you from Uranie and myself
