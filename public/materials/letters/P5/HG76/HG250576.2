well sacrifice another week and therefore staid at home. We began this
morning at F. V.'s and heard 2 good papers from Dr W.ck and the Moravian
Director KÅhn formerly a long time servg in SAfrica. Saw also Fritz Chev.
and other old friends. F V. still suffering from a troublesome illness,
will next week have to go to a bath. The letter of S. and E. in M. very
fresh and nice. This forenoon I wrote to Mt Clemens. I hope Joh. Mar. and
Dr. Sp. found at St. all they tried for. No prospect for the present abt
the hour of departure or arrival. The Scandinavian and Herm. f[rien]ds did
not come, those at Paris did not even answer. Dutch only 2 who have been
very silent. Lpzg unrepresented. Brn asked abt father and mother in law, I
ought to have visited there first, could tell him at least abt sister in
law. 8 children here busy with learning, musick, gymnastics. Plenty sneha
to all 3 houses. Goodbye
