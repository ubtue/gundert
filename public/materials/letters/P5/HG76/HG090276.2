Eben lese ich die AnkÅndigung des kirchl. Concerts Also bitte ich Dich auf
Freitg fÅr BT zu sorgen, if I knew that Gustav was there I should have
written to him, but now leave it to you. She would arrive 6.25 be fetched
by somebody that goes to the concert, sit at Church till it is over, go
then to G. (or whoever it be - but that seems nearest and she likes to see
children) pass night and day in seeing you all and physicking nursing cur-
ing E. and return with you Saturday evening. No need of farther letters if
these arrangemts can be carried out.
