Only a few words; for I am not in spirit for writing having to do with cel-
ler and garden. Many people ask after you, Resele Kapler prayed so warmely
for dear John in our prayer meeting Monday, both with many other look for-
ward with anticipation for the thursday meeting and we wish all and pray
that He may be a blessing for many, however he must remember his health for
which the present rest should be used, I have seen several time the Sper-
schneider the more I see of them the more I like them, they have happily a
nice girl after the useless one who went to Pforzheim she was so unclean
that one could not enter the cookroom so much it stank
