Forts.: 13 Mai 76
I have nothing particular to say, went yesterday and today with Adele out
and then to Steinhaus, found all well, and today Julchen came along when I
left to see her aunt Dote. She talks of her Papa a good deal and jokingly
acts as if she was crying when thinking of him, places her hands over the
eyes and cries Uh Uh!

I hope your journey has come off all well and that by 12.30 you were with
dear Uranie. We had fine weather on the whole. John had yesterday some mi-
graine but was well enough on the evening today he walked today with me.
Carl and Thodo were at Hof Dicke going with the milkboy, they had long been
sighing for a vacation journey.

L. Frohnmeyer's braut is a Miss Rommel, daughter of Kronenwirth at NÅrtin-
gen, but brought up at Kînigsfeld, pious and nice. He intends really stu-
dying divinity and becoming a minister, will therefore have to wait a long
time before he marries. No other news here about, My nights are good plenty
love to Uranie and to all the good people you see, the Gretillats, Nagel
etc. I hope you don't hurry back for my sake I have plenty of books just
received from England, so no want of entertainment. May all be closed hap-
pily and satisfactorily to everyone concerned
