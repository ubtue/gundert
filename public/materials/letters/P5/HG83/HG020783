Forts.: <2 VII 83>
The trip on Friday was hot, but I liked to see the Pl. at Lfn, had an
agreeable ride to Ilsfd and met there with the 3 cousins from Kaltenwesten.
The brother of Chinese Lîrch preached, then Fritz and I. In the evening re-
turned to Lfn and Bietigh with Fr. and slept at Pforzh. In the morning I
was there for Miss R and procured for her some coffee, made our voyage all
well under an increasingly tropical heat and arrived 1 1/2 at B. John Adis
Herm were there, also studts to take our baggage. Slowly we went our way
and got at last some rain that made us walk quicker under shelter. The 2
childr cough still very seriously. I hope to come Friday 3 P. M. for it is
desirable that the Hesses start on Saturday morning for their stay in the
country. I hope we shall not perspire too much. It is really very hot this
day, tho' it rains again at again. Dubois came here Friday evening and no
more since
