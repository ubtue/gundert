I intend to go tomorrow (Monday) to Eálingen, shall therefore be on the
perron from 9.30-9.35. bring with me maps of Grundem. and the Betb. which
Willy perhaps might fetch. You might also ask G Pl if he will not accompany
me to Mrs Kr. whom I purpose to see particularly. His coming along would be
a great pleasure. If not, he may perhaps tell Willy where I am to seek the
house of our late friend Kr

                       Goodbye for the present Yr F.

DV I return to you in the afternoon
