I would only say that Pr's death ought to be printed large "7 Apr. in
Accra, Goldcoast" I have in my mind to come and see dear Praet, if he ac-
cepts a visit, on Wednesday. Say in company of dear Georg who I suppose can
say if it is acceptable. Well I come and hear and see then for myself. Herm
has received letters. Just now Eugenie Els. will come to us - the bridepair
visited us yesterday. Goodbye for the present with kiss
