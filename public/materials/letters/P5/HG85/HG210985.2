611I take great interest in the Bible cause, for my father was 1812-54 Secr6y1
of the WÅrtbg Bible Soc6y1. which does I think so far its duty, that it sat-
isfies the demands of the kingdom. It has also contributed as well as Swiss
Soc6ies1 to the printing of the Mal N. T. in 68. I think also of the poâtical
books of the O. T. What seems to me essential is, that German societies
care for the people of this land, and learn gradually also to feed more
distant nations with the bread of life. But I for one do not see the neces-
sity of having One great Soc6y1. (Does not f.i. the Edinburgh Bible Soc6y1 the
needful both for Scotld and also for Scotch Missions in foreign parts?)
However if a man should feel himself called to work for the establishmt of
a Central Soc6y1 let him try! The Report of the WÅrtbg Soc6y1 which I join may
let you see why our people are on the whole more for a confederation of
Soc6ies1 than for the creation of a new agency. Any how I shall be glad to
distribute your letter in some 20 copies. I have yesterday buried my dear
wife (after 47 years of union, whereof 24 were passed in India), therefore
excuse kindly the shortness and disjointedness of my remarks
