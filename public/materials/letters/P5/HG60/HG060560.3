3. Ab hier Brief von Marie Gundert.
.
Here we are very near you. Last night at 9 o'clock we reached Corcelles -
first we had hoped to go direct to Basel and surprise you but in asking
about the way, we heard that the best way would be by NeuchÉtel Of course
we could not pass NeuchÉtel without going to Corcelles - Now we thought to
spend this Sunday here and go on Monday to Basel. But No 1: three pieces of
our luggage remained at Geneva so we have to wait for them No II: my Sis-
ters will not let me go so very suddenly. To morrow I shall send a telegram
to Marie Monnard, then she might come to us on Wednesday If so we shall
D.V. leave this on Thursday or Friday. - I am truly sorry to delay in see-
ing you, my own dear Sons, for I hoped to embrace you to day at 10 in the
morning already - but all must be for the best and who knows why I was to
see my sisters now? - I write to you, dear Boys, as I know that Papa is in
Calw - I send to every one of you an affectionate kiss and hope soon to do
it personnally well D.V. we meet soon and then shall relate you all. -
Please send this to dear Papa - farewell my beloved Sons May the Lord in
His grace grant us a happy meeting in His Holy Name.
