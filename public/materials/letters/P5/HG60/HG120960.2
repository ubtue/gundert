Forts.: 12 Sept 60
I am very glad to hear that you are forced to become English beyond what
you had imagined. You will know that Webster is a Weber, and that you are a
spinster oder eine Spinnerin: so I hope they may be enabled to weave some-
thing out of what you are spinning for them.

I do not see why you are to be bothered about Augustus' income. 4'000,000
Louisdor's is as I take it something like ú 12'000,000 of the present day -
a very poor income for any great empire, though I do not think that any
such statements allow of a correct verification: Any how the sum will ap-
pear big enough to any child. Take my Paul for an instance! How much he
longs to be a Millionaire and what does he not all intend to do with the
Million when he has got it. He is quite sure it is inexhaustible in every
sense. David protests most loudly against any and every project of making
him a preacher He might become a prelate, if that could be done immediately
after finishing his studies but stand upon a pulpit? Never if he can help
it! Now farewell und GrÅ·e an Deine liebe Mutter und Dich von Deinem
