I want not to tell you? Nonsense: I want to tell you, but I need not, that
your letter made? rather gave me great joy. But I will never give you thank
for it, but always thanks. A promise is never very nice fulfilled but al-
ways nicely: though fulfilled it is nicer than unfulfilled. I fully believe
you, when you say, we 2will1 have great joy to see you: I trust your inten-
tion is good, but when it will be realized, and you suppose this to be very
likely, you better say we 2shall1 - My health can never be well, only good -
but 2I1 may be well, though I 2am1 also 2good1, as every one can testify who has
looked into my heart and has found out its goodness under the black cover-
ing, which it seems does generally hide the inward treasure. - I have seen
Mr Widmann: and talked about the stipend to be obtained for Paul Mohl. When
I hear more about the conditions under which it is granted, I shall write
more at large to aunt Mary

Meanwhile farewell
