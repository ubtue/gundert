It is quite a new thing to write again to you. The last time I did it in
Engld (it could not reach you) once to Bomb may have come to hand. - I am
so glad you came the short way after all your transactions - and hope I
shall hear how it was brought about! God knows what it is for - certainly
it would have been a long cessation of all intercourse.

Now I hope you have not come too early but can stand the cool in the morn-
ings and I wish you quite to act as you find best. Perhaps you have come by
way of Geneva and Neuchatel - if not you may visit at least Corcelles and
Vevey if you like - but a little rapidly and then come to Calw. I hope to
meet you at Wilferdingen when I know the day. Also Sutter may come to see
you if you write to him

You would only take the train to Carlsruhe and embark after more than an
hour's stay, to be in 1/2 hour at Wilferd. From there 3 or 4 hours drive to
Calw. All of course waiting anxiously to see you. Now do all as you think
best and may God bless you with our 2 boys. In His love

P.S. I had long thought whether you would not take MÅller's Carl into our
new house but Mr Meuret it seems would rather keep him, and the family make
already a hubbub about the children. But if you think MÅller would like it,
try to thread the needle - should you think it right and proper.
