"there will Adolph" where Adolph will - or there A. will "till Cîlln" as
far as Cologne (till is only temporal) where we shall 2be1 till - stop till -
"till Wupperfeld" go on to Wup. - 8 o'clock in the evening = 8 PM (Post me-
ridiem, a latin expression, as A.M ante m. for the morning) - "He may do
what please him." No doubt! for who is to hinder him. But you meant proba-
bly to say May He do what pleases him! and to that I give my assent! -
Ernst came unexpected(ly.) - to bad - too bad. catched cold - caught it
rather. - Dr Barth is today better after he had been very ill. - so a kind
letter - such a kind l. or: so kind a letter. vacations? no: holidays
(Plur) or vacation (Sing.). So now try and make it out.

I pity poor Ernst and the Repetents. What if I know even that Pressel had
been appointed by the King to Esslingen, but the Consistory would not agree
to it! The good men at TÅb ought to learn how one pleases Kings: an art
which is not very popular in Universities.

Sunday I preached at Stammh and had a Miss[ionar]y meeting in the after-
noon. The boys with Mama came after dinner Mary had accompanied me in the
morning. Afterwds I was with Prelat <Moser>* and Dean <Haberle>* at Rie-
ger's, and saw also his uncle Dîrtenbach who lately lost his wife. Old Thu-
dium at the inn on the road to Hirsau, being very ill with dropsy has shot
himself this Sunday the poor man fancied that death was an end of every
thing, and so made an end to his pains. He could have lived but a few days
more if he had waited for death to summon him! Julie feels cold indeed, but
we do not as yet warm our stoves. - Barth expects Zaremba today but other
visitors are un peu de trop, and he is glad if they do not come. The Dr.
<MÅller>* wished me to write into every direction, that his patient ought
to be left alone, undisturbed by visitors; But I donot know if that would
have been of great use. You may mention this occasionally at Mr Cheva-
lier's. It may prevent some untimely visit. Now farewell. Do not stop too
long away from dear Swabia and
