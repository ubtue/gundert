Your English is excellent beyond all my conception. There are some errata,
perhaps mere slips of the pen as f.i. thougt (ght) sais - says RÅckenmark
is spinal marrow - "could be <by?> engaged with" might be affected. - De-
pending, as she did, 2upon1 her sister, not from! though of course this is
against the etymological meaning of the word. "At her passage" rather: when
passing through. An English passage is something long. It may indeed also
signify a sentence of greater or lesser length, but a traveller's passage
lasts from one shore of the ocean to the other. Makes a good impression on
me, rather than to me, or gives me a g. i. Sooner become German? grow to be
a German, certainly rather become 2a1 G. - could be a good teacher? 2might1 be.
all that she 2will1 say - all she is going to say to good an opinion - too g.
explain me - to me! I shall not be wearied with such corrections. For you
see I am already in the way of correcting proofsheets and it makes one feel
rather grand to find one point after the other, in which others are still
below the level one's self has attained to! Now you have Julie to talk to
you - she is not a correct writer, but a fluent talker if not speaker, and
so I hope you will put up with her for a season!
