Also schînen Dank an Fried fÅr sein liebes Versprechen und Brieflein. Zum
Antworten reicht die Zeit absolut nicht. Wie froh werde ich wieder am
Stillleben seyn. Hier gehen ganze Tage vorÅber ohne da· ich an den Schreib-
tisch zu sitzen komme. NB fÅr David habe ich etliche Postmarken, ganz rare,
Finland, Barbados, Canada etc. Hier gibts einen rechten Handel in stamps,
die theuersten sind alte Schweizer cantonsmarken, kostet eine 15 shilling,
es ist ein Buch herausgekommen, enthÑlt an 1300 Marken. Der Sohn des Hauses
hatte 900 gesammelt, verkaufte das um etliche Pfund, und hat schon wieder
700. Er thut aber sehr rar damit, und ich kann ihm nicht viel abschwÑtzen!
- It is strange to say so, but it is true nevertheless, that a journey is
not so fatiguing as life in London. No idea of rest I can assure you! Even
in the nights little sleep. The thoughts and impressions on the senses are
too manifold. I have seen the exhibition building in visiting Hebich, but
did not enter. I fancy there can hardly be much more inside than outside in
all the streets together. Heb. feels somewhat uneasy here, he is put off
from one day to the other. the people do not feel at their ease in letting
him preach. But he will make his way. Herm's story and the news from India
interested him much. He is very loving indeed, came also once to see me, (6
miles distance) but I was gone. He hides his collar somewhat and does hard-
ly look 2very1 strange now. Also the beard is not the longest met with here
abouts. Sessing is agent for the Wurtembergers as the exhibition. I hear
that he is making his fortune. - Dear Mann, Julie Gundert's uncle, has now
come to share my rooms. He has lost his wife very suddenly, the clever Walz
(Marie must know her, a particular favorite of the Staudts). Besides her
Mrs Hamilton is in the house, once Babette Bleiler, eine KleinunterhÑusle-
rin und grÅ·t M. herzlich. Sie ist sammt ihrem Mann zurÅckgekehrt. Many
thanks for the Indian news. I hope BÅhrer's letter will be returned by Mîg-
ling. For Krone I could not do more than what is written below. For where I
am to send them to, I don't know, and I cannot take them along. - Aunt mis-
takes about Helene. What can I do for her, when I have not even got her ad-
dress? I can't hunt after her as I did the last time, and then by a costly
wild goose chase. - Hermann's story comes of course up again and again.
Isenberg confessed to me that he also had been influenced by H's aesthetic
propensities about 1 year ago, and that it took a long time ere he recover-
ed from it and found that a calling must be taken up with undivided ear-
nest. He has now brought me a sealed enclosure for Herm. to whom I shall
also address a short letter. Now let us commit him to the Lord - may He
hammer at him till he gets into shape and becomes an instrument fit for the
Master's hand. I feel it will be a very difficult progress and perhaps a
wearisome transformation: but He will surely succeed and let us trust Him
for it with a whole heart. With true love
