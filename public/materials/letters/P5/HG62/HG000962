Dear Marie if you could see this girl of which you have here the address I
would be thankful to you, tell her from me love and I do not write her be-
cause I cannot write german, inquire much after her health, my love also to
Madele in Diakoniss Anstalt. If you could write English instead of German
at least that which may interest me I would be glad otherwise I know little
what you write as one has not always time to read me the letters, or I am
not there when they come and one forgets. I went to the W”hrle and thanked
for their present my love to all the dear people here all is going on as
usual with love yours afftly
