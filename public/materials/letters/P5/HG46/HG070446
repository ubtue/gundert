Forts.: 7 April 1846
Only a few lines to tell you in all haste that I received dear Papa's let-
ter with your enclosure, May God soon restore our dear mother with the
children. I part this evening for Staefa Ludwig will have heard of my ar-
rival through his Minister, who I am told stands in continual correspdce
with the Basle friends. I had a long talk today with Mr Spittler and the
young Mann who brought your letter. Tell the children to be good till I
come, also dear Marie must be quiet in her bed and all will be well in
time. Sunday <5 April Palmsonntag>* afternoon I preached in the Martins
church, exactly on the same day <12 April Palmsonntag.>* as 11 years ago. I
am pretty well satisfied with my visit, have also had my portrait drawn for
the Committee room. Rachel has a little boy. Christiane is Daniel's wife,
Marian the wife of Matthai. Both did choose for themselves. The schoolma-
ster in ___________________ Jacob is baptized and believes, has also got
his wife and children again. With love to all
