Forts.: 3 April <46>*
I have taken my time for writing, and beg your pardon for it - but it is
difficult in a house like this to sit down to pen and paper. 2Saturday1 <28
Mrz>* night I arrived at the post, where friend GÅnzler was waiting for me.
2Sunday1 <29 Mrz>* evening Mîgling arrived from a short excursion to Beuggen,
where Zeller had his birthday celebrated - 2Monday1 <30 Mrz>* evening Mis-
s-[ionar]y meeting Mîgling and I spoke to a thronged assembly in the Eliza-
beth Church. To The Committee members I was presented Sunday evening: and
dined on 2Tuesday1 <31/3>* with one of them Ryhiner, where Zeller also was
present. He has counselled Gobat not to accept the offer of the Jerusalem
bishoprick: I wish he would become bishop. In the night Mîglg went away.
Letters from India (Fritz) 3 marriages in Tellicherry amongst them Matthai
(the others I suppose Xaver and Nathanael - but the names are not mention-
ed) - Lydia goes on pretty well. Titus and Eliza are truly growing and send
love. Layer's have visited both Cann. and Tellich. 2Wednesday1 <1 April>* -
saw Linder, our financial Committee member. In the evening the first au-
dience before the Committee - questions about <many> things the C. MÅllers
are now definitively reunited with the Society - every thing that 2we1 can
desire is in a fair way of being granted - All long to have you soon here
to talk about your work. I ask a separate house for ourselves and girl's
institution, in which case you would I think have no objection to take a
helping Lady to yourselves, provided she be truly called by the Lord.
2Thursday1 <2 April>* - much with Hoffmann and the Diacon Linder, whom I like
particularly - also president Laroche. Indeed I shall rejoice if you will
soon be able to return with me to Switzerland. Tuesday <7 Apr>* evening I
intend to depart for ZÅrich but will not write beforehand Thursday <9 Apr
GrÅndonn>* I shall be obliged to speak at a meeting in Schaffhausen, from
where Mîglg has written.

It is not quite right that I receive no letters from Stuttg. I wonder how
you all are: If well why not rejoice me with a word? Kiss the children, and
ask them in my name to be patient and obedient. All what the boys and I
want in the shape of shirts, beds etc ought to be considered and noted down
I shall after my return send the list to Basle, from whence the auxiliary
working Societies will be commissioned with the execution of the work. Your
own wants will better be considered when present here. - Christ Sarasin
with whom I dined today wanted me to visit Geneva with him on the 1st of
May. but I declined as I will not speak in the Metropolis of Calvinism with
my heavy French tongue. Love to Papa Mama and the children - take care of
your health and pray for
