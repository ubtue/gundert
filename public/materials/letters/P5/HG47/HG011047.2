As Mr Gundert is sending a letter off tomorrow I will embrace the apportu-
nity of sending you a few lines. We were all very glad to hear from your
last letter which we received a month ago that you are improving in health
I hope it will continue and be always better. O how great is the loving
kindness of our Lord who does not deal with us after our sins nor reward us
after our iniquities how longsuffering is he and full of mercy. O that men
o that we would praise the Lord for his goodness and declare his wonders
which he doeth to the children of man. Indeed we have reason enough to
praise the Lord for he is our refuge and our salvation under the shadow of
his wings we lie in peace and safety the Lord enable us to praise him for
all that is past and trust him for all that is to come. You have very like-
ly long ago heard the news of the safe confinement of Mrs MÅller. Sister
MÅller and the baby are very well the baptism was on wednesday. her name is
Christine Marie our children are at present all well the small pox are not
amongst us now. little Christian is walking now quite round the house alone
he is sometimes rather proud of it and calls papa ___________.

Your dear baby does grow very fast he is very fond of laughing he puts his
little arms with kind tenderness round the neck of his dear nurse. The wea-
ther is now pretty fine Pauline and Mary are often complaining of cold but
I do not find it so. My dear husband also the sisters join with me in love
to you. Please to give my love to Mrs Weigle.

                           Your sincere sister
                                          J. MÅller.

M's daughter. - Frederick is weaned since the first of September - and now
as it is over and he is fast improving I am exceedingly glad. For I do not
like native nurses, except they be believers. In the end of the first week
he became a little sickly, but the Lord heard the prayers and blessed the
means, and he is now lively and joyful in spite of the beginning teething,
such as he never was with the Amah. He is a darling, no dearling. I shall
try to meet BÅhler at Calicut. - Vedamuttu has come again from Tinnevelly
and is repenting. Ananden is a dry stick. Arabella rather nice. - Dorcas
mother with all her children and the grandson is since some months in Qui-
lon, as Thompson had invited them, I could not say no. -
