Forts.: 15 Dec <1847>*
Being for a while here in Mr Hebich's place during his visit to Mangalore
and seeing that he delays to return, I think it my duty meanwhile to ac-
knowledge the receipt of your communication of the 10th Dec. and to state
that Mucwen Govinden, a youth of 20 years has already on the 8th Dec. on
his own accord returned to his relations, after the complaint brought by
them against him of having made away with some property of Coottan had been
dismissed by the Ameen as unfounded. As he now is living in great harmony
with the mother and his cousin Coottan having given up all connection with
the Mission, you my perhaps judge it unnecessary for Mr Hebich to enter in-
to further explanations of the circumstances connected with Moccwatty
Ayah's petition
