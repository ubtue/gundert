My poor wife will hardly believe it, but here it stands written boldly "2has1
2pardoned1" and she had showed me the first draft on the state, without any
doubt or fear. Perhaps it shocks you: I do not know if I feel it aright,
but it seems to me as if 2some1 pray always for assurance, but are afraid to
accept or to hold it when given, and therefore become again and again a
prey to Satan's influences. (The same is done by 2false1 assurance of
course). But wayward hearts that we are - To pray earnestly, repeatedly for
one thing and be afraid of it when it is given! Do you know the some? I ho-
pe the Lord may set up Missy to you as an example of his way of working.
How open now! how always ready to come and speak about heart and Saviour!
how earnest her prayer, how changed even in her features!

I can assure you she is the Lord's. Now I beg, rejoice 2first1 with the an-
gels in heaven over a sinner that repents and is converted, before you be-
gin immediately with your "take care"s. Would you spoil the first joy -
perhaps because you do not heartily partake of it, you hail the moment when
temptation assails anew, and then you may say: "there you have it, now you
see, was I not in the right." But even then if God give me grace, I shall
say no: for it is both right to rejoice and to be on his guard - each in
its own time.

I thank you very much for the kind letter and the useful lessons which you
wrote me, Isabella and I read some of the passages which you mentioned and
I know now the cause why I had no peace, and no faith, not only because I
doubted if God could forgive my sins but also because I kept back some at
the time when I wrote to you, and these sins troubled me very much, but af-
ter I confessed them I found peace and believe that the Lord has pardoned
me a sinner and washed me clean with his precious blood. Some of the girls
who confessed their sins have found peace and feel that their sins are for-
given, six of the girls are 2baptized1. Hagar, Martha, Lydia <31 Octbr 1847>*
Aline, Anna and Uranie, but there are yet some who have not repented. I beg
you, pray for them and for us that have repented that we may not fall again
asleep, Milkha was also baptized with those six girls, 8 boys were also
baptized, Hassan is amongst them his new name is Martin. About Louisa I
cannot tell anything, I am afraid to write to you about other girls, be-
cause I cannot see in their hearts, the three ladies, some of the Chri-
stians, Isabella and all the girls, send you their salams,
