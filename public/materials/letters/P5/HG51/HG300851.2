Forts.: 30 Aug 51
Only a few words in haste. Yesterday Friday morning I left Kaity <Koter-
ghery>* after receiving the enclosed. Got the parcel in Kunnur, and found
after opening the Macassars, that only one was somewhat coloured by the
picklejuice. I have lowered the price of this but raised the price of the
others. Arrived at Kaety all well, met on the road first by Ir. and then by
Mîr. Mrs Ir. appears better. Her hope is now risen, since it is certain
they go next week to Coimb. whither Dr Porteus has kindly invited them.
Nothing particular here. Only I heard from Ir. how strongly Huber longs for
Palgh. They must have had a disagreeable meeting at Tell. Fr. MÅller was
also some what out of the way. May the Lord give us love and patience ac-
cording to our want.

Now love to you all. As I am going in to Ooty I have no time to loose

                                             HG.

Fr. laughed when he saw me leave Kaety. he was to go with the BÅhrers to
the Cockb's plantation on that day.
