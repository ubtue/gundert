Only Selam and the news that all is right. David very well satisfied, when
I visit him, does not cry at night, but play occasionally from 2-3 in the
morning. - The box for the school has arrived - I opened it, very fine
dolls etc as Miss K. says who will take care of the whole. She would have
kept it unopened for you, though it was addressed to her. But I could not
understand why and so opened it -

Mrs C. M. has written to you about 7 Cotti* beurre and shoes. I shall try
to settle with him tomorrow. Miss K sends best love, Fred. his Selam chief-
ly also Alam to Vau and the dear BÅhrers'. I am anxious soon to hear that
you arrived safely and that Christian is well again - Now farewell
