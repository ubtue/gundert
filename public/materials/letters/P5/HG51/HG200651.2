Forts.: <20 Juni 1851>*
I take the liberty of addressing you at once, as if I was an old acquaint-
ance, on a subject which lies equally near to our hearts. It is about the
work of our Lord at Palghaut. We Missionaries had repeatedly had our atten-
tion drawn to that part of the province, from which some stray subjects
have occasionally found the way to our stations. Lately Mr Robinson had re-
peated descriptions and entreaties induced me to pay a visit there: and we
have written to our Committee on the subject, they do not see their way
clear to begin at once a new station, on account of the financial diffi-
culties, yet respond so far to our recommendation, as to permit for the
present our fixing there two Catechists if we see 2our1 way clear. - I was
somewhat surprized to meet at my visit with a Catechist of yours, having
had no information previously on this subject. I heard then from our breth-
ren on the hills, that you were somewhat surprized on your side by hearing
rumours of our intention to extend our operations into territory preoccu-
pied by you, without treating first with you on the subject. The reason why
I did not address you then, or since that time, lay entirely in the diffi-
culty I had to speak on the subject without any authorisation from our Com-
mittee. I intended however to write to you as soon as the first intimation
of their views should have arrived. The above is the substance of the an-
swer I received a few days ago <s. 20 Juni 1851>*. - It does not, I con-
fess, quite satisfy my mind. I have been assured of your willingness to
welcome us as neighbours in that part, if we were prepared to enter into
it. But it seems rather bold, to think of exchanging Catechist for Cate-
chist, when the supervision to be exercised it to come from even a greater
distance, than that of Coimbatore. Yet do I venture to ask you for your
views on the question. And here I would remark, that our object is not
especially the town of Palghat, but just as much the country population
around it; Malayalem as well as Tamil. Regular, at least half yearly visits
of Missionaries to be each time extended to some weeks are one of the con-
ditions which our Committee make. If in process of time some fruit should
be granted by the Lord, they would then think it the right moment for plac-
ing a full Missionary among the little flock. A member of our Committee is
to pay us a visit in Sept. or Oct. in order to go over all our stations and
see the working of some other Missions in the South of India. He will no
doubt give himself the pleasure of visiting also Coimbatur. Yet do I not
think it right to let the matter entirely rest till then or until I myself
might make your personal acquaintance, and have therefore told you how far
we are in our thoughts on the subject and what our prospects are. We have
not the least inclination to force the matter farther than God will have us
to go, and I shall therefore regard the answer which you may honor me with,
as a sign from Him either taking from me a care in a wrong direction or
urging me on to new exertions for the spread of His name. - Wishing you a
rich blessing on the labours of yourself your Son and all your associates

My Dear Dr. Gundert.

I am much obliged to you for telling me about Mrs Young, and I will go to
her, if the Lord wills, when passing through Cananore. - You did not send
me the parcel by your man, - you can send it now. - I trust the Lord may
restore your health if it be His Holy will, if not He knows best, and it is
a comfort to know He does all in love - In great haste - and with Christian
love
.fo -
                            yours most sincerely
