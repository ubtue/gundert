Forts.: 18 Apr 51.
I just now got your letters - many thanks. I send back in haste. there
being just an opportunity Eliz's letter, and hope she will take a lesson
from this and strive to do better in future. - You ask my <mind>* about Jo-
seph. I have told my mind years ago and see no reason to change it. - Fre-
derick was very much pleased with the Nondri. Foulkes and Sanderson rowed
him. Still after some time he moaned for Nanni, and when he landed related
to him all his experiences. - The next day I visited Dr Schmid with him,
for I had given N. leave to go over to the Bazar and buy something on the
market. He walked pretty well, What he could not walk I took him on horse-
back, viz. on my back. So he was very happy, ate plenty of meat returned
yesterday Wednesday morning with me. - Today GrÅndonnerstag <17.>* Papa's
letter came, I have hardly read it, all good news, I shall send tomorrow,
opportunity offering, but will not detain this. Fred. is decidedly better.
When BÅhrer comes I shall write about staying: wait till then. If Cugnen is
not better I wish him not to be baptized. Let his wife and mother rather be
taken before him.

Now farewell. They are waiting for me at dinner. -
