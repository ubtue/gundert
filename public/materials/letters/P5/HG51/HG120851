This is only to send you a Selam. You know that Pauline Weigle's mother
died the 10th June - in a happy state of mind towards the close of her
life. P. took it very well, says W. Ir. wished nearly to have his wife here
and to try our Dr (a Bombay man for a short visit of 2 months) - but he has
no instruments with him and can not undertake the case. Dr Johnston does
not come at all to see her as promised, nor would he even admit Ir. when he
paid him a visit always "no time." She has no pain, no discharge, but tend-
ency to continual weeping. - Lehmann had a most stupid beard which he
brought to Mang Mglg etc were much against it. At last he took it off.
Otherwise I do not see how Heb could have visited the next GeneralCfce! to
face such a rival would indeed have been a task! Some one, I think Mrs BÅh-
ler, has sent through Mîrike a bottle of Sugarseeds (Carraway comfits) for
Freddy. But he is very stingy with them and will not communicate properly
poor fellow - What a hardship to give - how blessed still to receive! - We
thought of getting Mrs Irion here in case the Dr could have done something
for her. Now they will perhaps have to go to Ottacamund to be nearer the Dr
there. - There is here nothing particular to tell. The mail has already ar-
rived! so I am looking for letters by and by. I hope yourself and children
are well. The Lord be with you -
