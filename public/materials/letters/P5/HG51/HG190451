Plenty Selams for the short cover of the 13th April. We shall remember you
tomorrow on Easter. I shall write these days to Ostertag and also to the
Committee giving a short extract from your letter to me about the feast,
that they have something meanwhile. To Ost. I have begun to give sense. The
Comm. wrote to Buhler that M”<gl.>* had reported an "untruth" about Kaity -
all mistakes of their own, for they read not attentively enough. But M.
does not mind it much. So you see that I have determined to stay some
months longer. I hope when the rains once pours down, you will be able to
write a bit now and then. - Give my love to the Youngs and all the friends
- We are always glad to hear of any of your doings in the Lord. - I am sor-
ry for Joseph's Eliza, but the Lord will surely do what is best for them.
Nath. is going on well and I believe recommends the Gospel to those who
have intercourse with him, in all humility. - We have no living native
Christians here. The mother of the girl that is to come to us is perhaps
the only one! Pray for us, as we for you
