Yesterday I sent a letter. Today having received yours of the 13th with Pa-
pa's I send this merely as cover. You may read all and have it read and
then send to Mîgling as before. - BÅhrer went this morning to Kaity. Mîglg
has persuaded Lehmann to cut off his beard, but he seems to have repented
afterwards - poor fellow! he found Scripture reasons and what not all to
defend it agst Deggeller for a considerable time. But that there was vanity
in it, he could not see. However I do not think he will let it grow again.
But what would in such case to have been done with Dietz. I only trust he
will never think of it. - I hope your sister will soon give some news. She
may have heard of the Carawan and therefore have sent a long letter with
other things for them to take along. - I have written to Papa and Samuel
this very day, to try once the via Trieste, which way Mrs Buhrer continual-
ly writes to her parents in WÅrtembg. Do not trouble yourself about the
windows in case the workmen have left already. Well I trust you have peace
in the house, no disease and a quiet mind. May Grace abound to you and
.fo -
