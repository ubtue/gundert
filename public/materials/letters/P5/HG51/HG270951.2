Forts.: 27 Sept 51
Today my King is 70 years old and Ernst will leave the University. But
that's not very important to you. The 25th evening I left the Irions on his
pony and came 8 miles where I met mine and found it not at all so agreeable
as it looked at first, very much like a Tattoo - Came to Valiar and stopped
in the Bangalow. Also this 2d horsekeeper does not answer, he seems never
to have been beyond his native place nor to have served gentleman. We slept
too long - awaking often before the time, but not at 3 - so I had a hot
ride - but no matter, met a peon with note from Robinson, inclosing your
letter, wondered about Mglg's proposal, and felt no wish for it. Indeed I
do not think we are auth... to give her away on the very first proposal, in
a way which would look very much like securing her 3000 Rs to the Mission.
I would rather wait till she can have more ability of judging for herself,
and I should besides like to hear what her relations think on the whole
matter of marrying.

I came to Robinson about 9 o'clock. He told me that Huber wrote to him
strongly against the plan of sending 2 Catechist's, that they would cost 30
Rs per month, all money thrown away, that the 2 MÅllers are also on his
side, that he will agitate with the Comm. that he has seen the house he
<Rob.> wished to buy for the Mission and his judgmt about it and the re-
pairs necessary for it, and that building quite new premises would still be
better. Rob has answered none of his 3 letters but became perplexed: and
therefore he has* not written to Heb. He would indeed prefer a Miss[ionar]y
at once, and would rather give 1000 or 1500 Rs more for it. Also Frere,
Horsky etc are against the plan of having Catechists on the other hand Hu-
ber...621 too personal a light with him, and he will say nothing to him, so
rather wait, till Jos. comes. - He and Mrs R are indeed very nice. I leave
this evening in Rob's bandy part of the way, and think to arrive about Fri-
day under the guidance of our Lord. Love to all!
