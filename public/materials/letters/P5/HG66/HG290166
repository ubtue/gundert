Or wash has come to day all right. As papa is going to Stutgart, I thought
it would be good perhaps if Mr Weiss could come with him on Saturday. On
Sunday papa has to preache to Aldbourg after which a meeting. in the
schoolroom in Aldboorg. this might interest Mr Weiá Would not tante Caroli-
ne come with him? but no it will be better in Summer when one can walk in
different villages near Calw. How are you dear son? happy in the Lord I
trust no? did you perhaps write to Paul on his birthday? We are looking out
for news from Samuel, Emanuel Gross is some what better fom Rudolph no
news.

There are much sickness in Calw, and about, nervous fiver Schleimfever etc
almost every day a burrying.

Love to all I pray,
