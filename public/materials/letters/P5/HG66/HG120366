Today we expected to have letters from you both; but nothing has come; per-
haps you had no time. When papa got up this morning early, his first words
were today we get letters from Stutgart! and behold no letter, One from
Paul which gives us joy the Lord is very gracious to him: and He is to you
too no?

Apropos on Saturday you are to send me again your wash you and David 2in One1
2box1. we wash so soon on account of Pauls things. As you have few things
this time forget not to send the plumon or deke zieher you know what I mean
a colored big piece.

13 Many thanks for your wellcome letter. So the Lord is also gracious to
you and helps you through, you are right we believe man more than Gott, it
is a shame; but it is so, in this we see the patience and longsuffering of
the Lord. let us pray for a living real faith!

Today I heard that Gotthold Steiger is ill he has the same illness which
you had and still continues teaching; but he suffers rather much, his fa-
ther will try to get him home for a few weeks, only it is difficult because
of want of teachers. Please tell dear Mr Albert Weiss, that I am quite ge-
rÅhrt at his sending me so much prunes, and I thank him heartily. How much
did you pay for your wash? I had paid here, I thought papa had paid my debt
long ago.
