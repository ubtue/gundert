Forts.: 19th Dec 1866
Thanks for your last letters by which we can see that the Lord is gracious
to you and carrys on his work in you, though slowly, that which He has be-
gan He will undone <not leave unfinished>611: we have good confidence in Him

These days in which we expect the three younger sons with us remind us spe-
cially of you, how glad would we be, if you with your dear ones could be
here too, not to see a tree with lights; for we have none; but the joy to
be together, your two daughters would be the chief persons in the feast;
perhaps God will greant us such joy once. we wait with patience. meanwhile
live so as if we should soon meet together before the Lord. We have had a
great deal of rain and storms, many people die rather suddenly. Marie Mon-
nard inquires always after you and was very glad of the good news we could
give her. but you say nothing of dear Christina how is she? A tender kiss
to her and to your two sweet babies Adieu dear Son
