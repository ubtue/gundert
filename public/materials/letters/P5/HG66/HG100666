Forts.: 10th June 1866
I hope you have a good day and feed on the word of life. to day I have read
the last chp of the Eph, I thought of you in reading it. in it we see what
kind of wepons or armour we are to put on in order to fight and stand,
firm, the last 18th ver has specially drawn my attention. we understand as
yet but little how to pray. "praying 2always1 with all prayer and supplica-
tion in the spirit, and 2watching there unto1 with all 2perseverance1 and sup-
plication for all Saints. Tell dear Frederic are we not very far from know-
ing this continual prayer? I trust you continue to pray with David; when
the devil comes with all sorts of reasons and hinderances, you withstand
him and believe firmly the promise the Lord has made in Matthew 18.19 if
you should not see immediatly a answer or a blessing nevermind pray only,
the Lord must be true to his promise and sooner or later answer your
prayers, He alone can make you firm unmovable, keep you so that your are
neither high nor low or cast down, He is a Rock and on Him we must rest
Adieu dear F
