Many thanks for your having written so quickly. I am verry sorry that you
have still so stomachache you must beg Tante to let you have a Krug or
bettflashe in your bed; and you should bind your stomach with a flanell I
shall send you one when I send Davids Åberzieher on monday. till that you
might take your old flanell banian or your schawl.

               Let us know soon how you are with love to all
