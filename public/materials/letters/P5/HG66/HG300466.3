I have visited Mr Wirz and invited him for Mission, feast of which he was
very glad. He told me of having seen you and your having renued the per du
that s right. As I am not sure wether you come or any one from Suttgart I
will not let your box go without a few lines. If it continue to rain as to-
day we shall have left people than it would have been otherwise, How is
tante Anne why does not Unkel Adolph comes? and Albert? We have quite room
enough.

Now Adieu
