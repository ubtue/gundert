7th evening today I have been more with you than usual, I trust you have
had a good day felt that men and specially God love you dearly. It is som-
thing precious to be able to believe that one is loved. this alone takes
away fears and doubts. We are touched at the idia of some body loving us;
but what is the love of creatures they change, but our Lord who has once
redeemed us loves us always with an Eternal love. Why have we so difficult
to believe his love? We would have so much more easier if we were quite
sure of his great and constant love. We would care much less for creatures.
8th Your letter has just come for which many thanks. I thank the Lord that
you experienced so much love. tell us also what token of love you have re-
cieved from other people, and who are the friends who showed you kindness?
We like to know every thing. To morrow I go to Nagold with Mr. Widman, we
return the same evening. My love to the dear people in your house; has tan-
te Anna told you nothing for me? from whom are the Zwetschen; the Gichtpa-
pier has not come. Yes dear Son live so with the Lord that you hear his
voice and be led by him alone by his precious word. Adieu

Have you still got the key of your old wash KÅstien or have you given it to
David? If you have it send it to David that he may open it I have sent him
the old box and one of you must have the key
