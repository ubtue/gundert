Only a few lines from me this time, to thank you and your dear wife for the
few lines I recieved by the last mail. Herman Gross of whom you have al-
ready heard brings you two knitted Kittele for the expected baby. I would
have liked very much to send you something else; but papa feared that the
things would perhaps not reach you, as the young man is not quite sure, al-
so not accustomed to travel. I trust the Lord will help graciously Christi-
na for the time she expects. We are all well and see with pleasure the va-
cances coming, to have the children with us, although Frederic and David
will have only one day for us, With love to you both kisses to Julia
