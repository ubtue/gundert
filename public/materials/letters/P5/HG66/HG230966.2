Give please this note to Mrs. Isenberg, she will tell you whether I can
loge with her when I come, she will perhaps also invite Paul, as tante Anna
has had people enough all this time; you may hear all. I shall be the
saturday with the Isenberg the sunday in Olga St the monday in Hoch St. I
think you will be glad to see Paul still once before he goes back to Maul-
bron and I shall be glad to see you once more before the Winter. Several
things from Unkel Theodore have bin left here we send them per paquet to
Stutg I trust you have a good sunday
