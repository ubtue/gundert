Before all I must beg you to be so kind and send me for a sexer Gichtpa-
pier, I wish to see whether it is better than here, for some years Mutter
had sent me some which was very nice green; it is not for me,

You should not be troubled about speaking or not, let yourself be led
quietly by the Lord He will tell you when you are to speak one makes to
oneself lows and duties which make us often unhappy, pray the Lord to guide
you, force not your way; but be obedient to the spirit of the Lord, you
have to do with the Lord and not with men, loock upon him, wait when you
have prayed upon his unswer; We are curious people that I feel for myself,
how much patience must my Lord have with me. I forget so soon that I have
to do with him alone, that I should continually hear his woice and follow
him.

Adieu dear Freddy pray much you shall get much
