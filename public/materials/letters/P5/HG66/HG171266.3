Many thanks for your good letter, soon we shall be D.V. together, it would
be of course nice if you could come on Saturday; but to learn obedience is
surely better, the Lord gives us joy when we fight against self and He
gives us the victore.

Mrs. Gross has just come so I must finishe forget not your wash and Davids
in your box with 2meerredig1 and a 2pound of Chocola1 from Weiá
