Only a few lines to ask you if you could perhaps send me by papa a few
Meerredig, if you cannot that is if it gives too much trouble leave them
till next opportunity; but if you can I shall be glad, he can take some in
his bag. You will have very little of papa dear children, as he will al-
ready return on the same day; but in 9 weeks we shall DV. have one day to-
gether here perhaps two days. Do you live far away from Uhlandstrase where
the poor Christian Steiger is? if not try to see him Gotthold was with him
on Sunday, one had hope that he would soon return home; but the inflamation
in one eye has returned so that now he must remain longer there, his poor
mother is much distressed about him, all the people in the Uhlandstreet
know where lives the Doctor Berlin where Christian is.

Adieu dear Son love to all in your house
