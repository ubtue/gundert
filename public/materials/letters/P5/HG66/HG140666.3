Forts.: 14th June 1866
I hope that you are well, and full of thanks towards the Lord who has so
graciously spared your life last week. We have continual warning to be
ready, for a quick summon of the Lord, as also to teach us to be more de-
pendent on his keeping and watching over us. yea so dependant on Him that
we learn to pray before we begin a work, a walk, a visit in short before or
during all that which we do, that is what is meant by the words praying
without ceasing; is it not? God has sent his angels the other day to turn
away, to hinder that which might have hurt you or taken your life, such oc-
curences, should humble us, make us very thankful, and confident towards
our good Lord, but often we feel as if there were some merits of our own,
as if we had been so clever as to escape by turning this this or that way.
our wicked heart is deceitful above all. Is it not the Lord has long pa-
tience with us, till we at last condemn us and dispise ourselves? learning
to trust Him 2alone1, distrusting ourselves always more and more. I hope you
have a good time and get also blessings through Mr. Hebich You will be so
kind as to send me your wash on monday 18th. forget not the curry staff;
but specially the Meerrettig! the servant girl has put them in the Keller?

Give my love to all our dear people specially to tante Anna and Caroline!
is the wash finished?

Have you got your cloth for trawsers? You shall tell me how they fit and
how much the tailor did ask you

                            Now adieu dear Son
