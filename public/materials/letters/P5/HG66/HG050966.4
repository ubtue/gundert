I first thought to write you a long letter by David; but now you will have
heard that he is not yet well and stays with Charles till Saturday or Mon-
day;

Dear Son are you well, did I perhaps trouble you when I was in Stutg I had
so very little time and so very tired that I neglected you quite. I felt it
and was uneasy but then here found so much to do that I could not write,
Why did Mr. Weiss not come we expect them yesterday and to day, Are they
not gone to Pforzheim?

My dear Frederic excuse me that I did not write sooner but I feel tired
from Nagold trip. give my love to all

2. Brief ohne Datum von Julie Gundert auf angeklebtem Zettel - wohl vom
___25./26.8.66, vgl. Schlu· des Briefes "in Kirchheim today".

You may well put on two shirts in the week and 3 three pair of stockings,
you have enough of both to do it; it is also better for you to be clean, it
is healthy. Perhaps that I shall see you in a fourtnight. I shall perhaps
take farewell from Elisabeth in Stutg with Paul when papa shall go with her
to Bale

It appears to me a long time since we heard of you or from you; however pa-
pa will soon bring me news, and I will wait to send your box till he has
returned. You are perhaps with him in Kirchheim today, while I am sitting
very quiet at home; but I have a good day with Gods word in which I find
all what I want. May you also find in it much food and blessings, it is for
the hungry and thursty,

                       Adieu ma dear son Yours J.G.

your letter about David makes me to come to Stutg
