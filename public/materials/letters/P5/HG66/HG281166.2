Many thanks for your kind letter, the Lord be praised that he gave you the
victory over yourself, so that you could forgive, if there were no opportu-
nities for us to forgive others, we would not know how bad we are, nor un-
derstand why the Lord said "pray for you ennemies" I would not have known
it if we had not come in this house.

I trust it will soon be over with Tante Anna can she nurse her big son? it
will be very difficult with a sore breast it is very painful at least.

Still four weeks not even and DV we shall be together tell me please how is
David? you did not answer my question about Christmas. Had Mrs Isenberg no
letter from Elisabeth? At Christmas you shall bring or send your box with
yours and Davids wash and specially the Meerredig.

Adieu my dear son
