Your two last letters have given me joy and also what papa and Samuel said,
in your "heimwhe" God seekes you and you have grace to seek Him. He lets
Himself soon be found the dear Lord who waits daily continually for us is
soon found by those who are true and earnest. Above all dearest son read
Gods word and good books; if you do that with prayers, you will soon be
happy and find that you have in God a tender father and in the Lord Jesus a
Saviour a friend a brother, and that to have communion with Him is better
than father, mother and all the best friends. I hope you find already joy
in praying and if some times there comes dark moments and doubts pray the
more and think of the words which say resist the devil and he will flee
from you. You would also do well to read again your pilgrims progress it
has already helped many young souls who like Bunyan have left the city of
destruction to go to the heavenly city, the devil, the world, our wicked
hearts cause us some time fearful fights; but we must be of good chear have
good courage our dear Lord has overcome and with Him by His grace we shall
also over come. But fight we must like good soldiers and our best weapons
are prayer and gods word, dearest Frederic, to pray morning and evening is
not enough we have to do with many enemies and we want much grace and
strength. I have confidence that the Lord has already taken you in His
school and teaches you; May you be so convinced of the love of the Lord to
you that you may be full of joy. And whenever doubts come in your mind
whether you are indeed loved by the Lord look at it as a temptation of the
devil and try to believe more and more and say yes my Lord and Saviour
-oves me.

Your last has just come with the fotograph you look in it pretty dark, I
trust you do not allow yourself to be so cast down and dark, it makes the
people round you sorry and anxious it may appear as if it was against them
therefore avoid as much as possible to have the black dog.

I send you dearest son some heidle beer with some cake of the same and some
of the goodly of the Wedding which has just taken place. Your brothers had
imagined that they would be invited to it and on account of their dis-
apointment they refuse to eat the good things which have been given for
them so you get their portion at least some of it

Dearest Son try to overcome the darkness which falls on you on account of
heimwhe it will soon pass away

With a tender kiss

611Mein herzlieber Friederle! Wie freut es uns allemal wenn ein Brief von Dir
kommt, und gestern noch das gutgelungene, herzignette Bild dazu! Mein lie-
ber Friedel sei nur heiter und gutes Muths, der Heiland hat Dich ja lieb
und macht Dich gerne glÅcklich, Du mu·t Ihm nur viel zutrauen.

Gestern war Scheffel's Hochzeit und heute reist das junge Paar fort. Paul
und David sammt den zwei andern waren sehr beleidigt, da· sie nicht einge-
laden worden waren, sie hatten es scheints ganz fest erwartet. Paul ist
ganz ingrimmig und will auch die geschenkten Gutle nicht anrÅhren. - Mama
bittet, du mîchtest Gro·mama mit Deinen Heidelbeeren nicht belÑstigen, wenn
Du sie nicht allein bemeistern kannst, so kriegst Du gewi· ganz leicht ei-
nen Helfershelfer, der Dir beim Vernichtungswerke beisteht. Nun la· Dir al-
les recht schmecken, mein lieber, lieber Bruder. Sam und alle grÅ·en herz-
lich. Es kÅ·t Dich Deine (eilige) treue
