Your welcome letter of yesterday has rejoiced me very much, yes my dearest
it helps one to pray Surely our Lord and heavenly father loves us so very
much yea more than any earthly parent can do, only we cannot believe it;
but in the same measure fears and doubts are driven away from our hearts
are we able to believe His great love to us. I often thought when my dear
son feels himself among strangers he will begin to seek God for his portion
and friend. I am glad you have no liking for Conrad W. avoid companies
which can hurt you, seek your old frend Frederic MÅller he has just now va-
cance for some weeks he may help you to find in Stutg a propre friend with
whom you might have walks and perhaps empty your heart and do your self
good We pray that God might give you such a good dear friend; and till you
find such one rather keep to the Lord alone. You did not tell us how is
your chest have you no pain? My sickness dearest Frederic was specially a
great weakness and also diarrhee. I am thank God better; but I must keep
quiet for I have not yet much strength to run about. You must have patience
about Beiser having broken your things, it is indeed provoking; but what to
do?

You will soon see your dear brother Samuel who will give you all the news
about us all. Carl is I think becoming some what more diligent. Paul as
ever at his lessons the whole day. Herman Gross is again well but still at
home and glad to have his Rudolph these weeks. David is the old David too
high minded, Heinrich as lieb as ever. I fear I schall not see you next
sunday; but papa will bring me news of you. As I schall have to go to Stut-
gart for Tanteles marriage or during the days that Paul shall be there for
the landexamen I will avoid going now away.

I must tell you Adieu my dearest Son Frederic. Read your Bibel and good
books

611Sei nur gutes Muths. Der liebe Gott hat noch viel in Seiner Schublade fÅr
Dich. Wenn Du Ihm ein lustiges zutrauliches Gesicht zeigst, zieht Er es
nach einander heraus und macht Dir Freude damit bis Du die Augen auf-
sperrst. Darauf ists abgesehen mit aller Schwere die das Herz drÅckt. Nun
lebe wohl! Der HErr mache Dich frîhlich und zufrieden
