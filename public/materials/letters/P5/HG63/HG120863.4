Da Dein liebes Mutterle Dir schreiben will aber nicht viel weil sie etwas
Schmerzen in den HÑnden hat so darf ich den Brief mit ein paar GrÅ·en von
mir anfangen, Dein Brief den Du Deinem lieben Vater sendest ist auch zu uns
gelangt, es ist recht lieb von Euch da· ihr uns so treu Bericht abstattet
wir sind immer in Gedanken bei Euch Lieben und ich bitte den lieben Vater
im Himmel flei·ig fÅhre meine Lieben an Deiner treuen Vaterhand Du und mei-
ne liebe Emma dÅrft Euch wohl fÅr Geschwister ansehen und ausgeben dann ist
allem Gerede ein Ende gemacht. Herr Pretorius war sehr gÅtig da· Er Euch
noch so was krÑftiges brachte unser lieber Vater im Himmel thut Seinen Kin-
dern tÑglich viel Gutes so sie Ihm vertrauen! Der Herr segne und behÅte
Dich. In treuer Liebe kÅ·t Dich Dein Mutterle

621My very dear Samuel

Your letter to papa has given me joy I also thank God that you have to go
to Cannanore although I believe it will be difficult for you in many re-
spects on account of the many bretheren there; but God who calls you will
help and teach you how to walk and speak so that you give no offence nei-
ther to the heathen nor to the church of God. Slow to speak ready to hear
with a spirit of dicernement enable us to bear much and deal with wisdom.
to be able to keep our judgment or rather to form none till we are certain
we see things with Gods light keeps us in peace with God and among each
other. May God give you grace and wisdom waiting in silence what God will
have you to say to do and when you are convinced of the will of the Lord
being such deal than courageusly your heart fixed on Him whose will you are
to execute in the midst perhaps of much difficulties and trouble, If it is
sweet to live with brethren there are also many hard lessons; therefore
2Slow to speak slow to pronounce a judjement1 May the Lord keep you in per-
fect peace.

I regrette, not to have sent an album for photograph to Miss Will as you
are to be near her. I shall D.V. do it next opportunity Give her my special
love and may God give her joy and peace waiting for his comming.

I will dearest son tell you Adieu and add a few lines to dear Emma

                       Your affectionate Mama J.G.

My beloved Tantele

Your last from Basle has rejoiced us much seing how gracious has been our
Lord iether too and it is but a begining of His goodness He has in store
much more for you expect only much from Him and you shall get much. His
treasures are full; but we must faithfully drow and pompe from the fountain
always open to us. Sweet dear sister you know the secret how all things are
possible to God and to him that believeth. Yea believe. Oh for more of that
precious faith which overcommeth. Be of good chear be courageous The Lord
is your fore and arriere Guard. Many pray for you and I am sure you will
now and than feel as I did in the midst of the work when harrassed and fa-
tigued scarslely able to pray a power a new life was communicated, then I
felt clearly others have helped me You would rejoice to see dear Mama and
tante how comforted and quiet, how they speak to every one of the grace of
God, it is to me a real wonder, May God keep them continually as he has
done till now. Love to dear Georg to Perci Adieu my very beloved tantele
