Forts.: 10th June 1863
Accept my thanks for your last note full of affection and tender feelings,
the time runs very fast and soon papa will leave us to join you and come
again with you both I trust. I am very glad you injoye your visit so much
and thank all the friends who are kind to you, I am very sorry to hear dear
Dr Ostertag is so poorly, in which bath is he going?

Gustele has got a nice place with a Mrs. Mayer at Berg, tantele wrote about
her and she is to go imidiatly, Louise was to come to day; but has not ar-
rived with the post as I excepted but I trust to morrow; poor Gustele got
so ill this morning that she could not mouve I really feared she was to get
a illness however this evening she is some what better and she has gone to
her sister Dirlam where she remains till mondag and then will go to Berg.
The two Verreins of Ladies and children were as usual Mrs Zahn Emelie Seg.
sister came too. The bilding is going on; but it will not be finished for
the marriage. to day it rains much and as a part of the roof has been pull-
ed down our Cook room and Speisekammer were rather wett from the above
rooms. Papa does not look well it was I think too much for him to walk to
Kanbach Herman Gross has the Gastrishefever he walked sunday from Calw to
his house and had to go to bed. Frederic is sad to have no prospect of a
place for next month when his time will be over and he will not remain with
the Wirzes because he cannot weave and does not like wolle sortiren or nop-
pen. we have had the tailor already 10 days and he must still come next
week.

Now that shall I say more except that I wish you many blessings. I am glad
you make your dress in Bale. love to dear Samul and to all the dear
friends. Specially to the dear Ostertag and to their young ladies

611Sind die Mather von Benares? Jos. Knapps Gedichte lassen sich schon brau-
chen, doch trÑgts die Form Åber den Inhalt davon; die Gedanken sind nicht
reich und es fehlt die eigentlich poetische NaivitÑt. Man wird mehr an
Kunstproducte gemahnt. Gustele gieng am Mittw. mit Anfang von gastrischem
Fieber. Am Freitag kam Louise Maurus. Daneben ist auch Evameile hier be-
schÑftigt.
