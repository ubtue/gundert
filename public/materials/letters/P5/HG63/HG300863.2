I am glad to hear that you are better and I trust that you are also more
cheerful and that dear Yettle may bring us good accounts of you. If you
find so many difficult to join the Junglingverrein I think it will be as
good for you to practise your French and English than to force to yourself
to go where you find no pleasure perhaps next year you may like it better
then you may join it and for this winter I wish you good courage and dilli-
gence to practise the two languages you have bigan to learn here. I shall
the evening fancy you in your room reading or learning and now and then
saying had I used my time well when I had teachers I would now know much
more. but be only of good chear set at work earnestly and it will be easy
for you especially if you pray along with studying.

Dear Freddy I feel often uneasy about you since I saw you so cast down and
sorrowful. You must try dear son to overcome you have many reasons to thank
God try to find out for how many good things you have to praise then you
will find that you have much better than many others. tell once to your-
self, now I will be happy and joyful and when sadness, cares, darkness
comes I will pray and say I must overcome, all this is from the devil I
must overcome and try to be joyful. If you really do that for some time you
will soon find that you have the victory over the devil.

Neglect not praying often and reading the word of God.

I have seen Mrs. Wirz she is not well less well I fancy than when she left
this for the bath; but it is perhaps only the fatigue of the journey.

I was glad to get again to Calw after so many days of rest with dear Mama
and tante who were so kind to us all. It is indeed a great favour to have
such a house such loving people always ready to help and love others not
thinking of their own comforts. tell please to both of them many hearty
thanks from me for their love to me and to you as well as to Paul.

Papa has gone to Hirshau for the meeting he is better than when at Stut-
gart. Paul is lieb. David as ever, likes to do his own will. Adieu my dear-
est Freddy
